{"id":46,"text":"Anonymous Hacks 2 Russian Industrial Firms, Leak 112GB of Data for Ukraine\nAnonymous has taken Operation OpRussia a step further by targeting MashOil and RostProekt, which happened to be giants in their respective industries.\nThe online hacktivist group Anonymous has claimed responsibility for targeting two Russian companies stealing a trove of their data and leaking it online for the public to download.\nMashOil is a Moscow based company known for designing, manufacturing, and maintaining equipment used in the drilling, mining, and fracking industries. According to the company’s website, “MashOil LLC is the official representative of the FID Group in the Russian Federation.”\nFID Group on the other hand is a group of Belarusian and Russian enterprises specializing in manufacturing equipment for the oil and gas industry in both countries. However, Anonymous has claimed responsibility for targeting the company and stealing a whopping 110 GB worth of its data.\nThe data includes over 140,000 emails which can be downloaded via torrent and is available on the official website of Distributed Denial of Secrets (aka DDoSecrets), a non-profit whistleblower organization.\nOn Twitter, @YourAnonNews, one of the largest social media representatives of the Anonymous movement also confirmed the hack.\nRostProekt is a Russian construction company based in the city of Ivanovo. Anonymous claimed to target the company over the weekend and leaked 2.4GB worth of files containing email data. The files can be downloaded via torrent from the official website of DDoSecrets.\nAs seen by Hackread.com, according to the information posted on the website, RostProekt operates in the “construction, foundation, structure, investments, and building exterior contractors’ industry.\nRostProekt data breach was originally announced by @DepaixPorteur, an Anonymous affiliate who also played a vital role in hacking unsecured printers in Russia and sending anti-war and anti-censorship printouts across the country. While addressing the Rostproekt breach, @DepaixPorteur said that,\nWe are Anonymous. We have created a new site to host our upcoming leaks + future Anonymous leaks. We also hacked Rostproekt emails as a treat to celebrate the new site & to hold you over while waiting for the upcoming dump(s).\nIt is worth noting that Anonymous has launched two new websites where the group has been publishing download links and details of previous and future data dumps under Operation OpRussia to mark a protest against the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nIn an exclusive conversation with Hackread.com, @DepaixPorteur revealed that their group is currently working on a large-scale data leak belonging to sensitive Russian institutions. Anonymous said that they plan to leak 1.22TB worth of data in the next couple of weeks to mark a protest against the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nIt is no secret that Anonymous is standing strong with Ukraine over the ongoing conflict between the two countries. The group has so far targeted both the government and the private sector to spread its message.\nOn March 26th, 2022, Anonymous not only confirmed breaching the Central Bank of Russia, but also leaked 28GB worth of banking data via DDoSecrets. The list and timeline of some of the cyberattacks reported by Hackread.com on the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine are as follow:\nAnonymous Leak 82GB of Police Emails Against Australia’s Offshore Detention\nIn total, Anonymous leaked 285,635 confidential emails belonging to the Nauru Police Force of the tiny Nauru Island infamously known for being used by Australia as an offshore refugee detention center in return for aid.\nOn Monday, May 2nd, 2022, the Anonymous collective released 82GB worth of emails apparently belonging to the Nauru Police Force. According to Anonymous, the data leak was in protest against the alleged ill-treatment of asylum seekers and refugees carried out by Island authorities on behalf of the Australian government.\nFor your information, Nauru is a tiny island country in Micronesia, northeast of Australia infamously known for being used by Australia as an offshore refugee detention center in return for aid.\nAs seen by Hackread.com, the total number of leaked emails is 285,635 and available for direct and torrent download through the official website of “Enlace Hacktivista,” a platform that aims to “Document hacker history.”\nAlthough Hackread.com could not analyze the trove of emails, in a statement, Anonymous explained that the leaked confidential emails contain details related to abuses that the Nauru Police Force and the Australian government tried to cover up.\nThe statement also demands an end to the policy of mandatory immigration detention and the permanent closing of immigration detention facilities, including on the island of Nauru.\nAnonymous also urged authorities to launch an investigation of all allegations of abuse in the immigration detention centers and pay lifetime reparations to victims.So we decided to hack the Nauru Police Force, who were tasked by the Australian government with policing the island and obtained 285,635 confidential emails related to abuses that they tried to cover up, and we are making them all public. The Republic of Nauru has previously disputed reports of torture, sexual assault and child abuse on the island. Can they still dispute this when all their emails are out in the open? The things we saw and read made us sick. We are asking the newly elected Australian government to by the end of 2022: ~ End the policy of mandatory immigration detention and permanently close immigration detention facilities, including on the island Nauru. ~ Grant permanent residence to all asylum seekers, including the 124 people forcibly moved out from Manus Island. ~ Investigate all allegations of abuse in the immigration detention centres and pay lifetime repairations to victims. Anonymous!\nOn Twitter, Emma Best, journalist, and co-founder of a non-profit whistleblower organization DDoSecretsDistributed Denial of Secrets, aka DDoSecrets, confirmed the leak. Best also announced that the enormous data dump is also available on DDoSecrets.\nOn the other hand, @YourAnonNews, one of the largest social media representatives of Anonymous also tweeted about the data leak stating that “Anonymous hackers release 1\/4 million Nauru Island Immigration Detention Center Police emails documenting abuses suffered by asylum seekers and refugees under successive Scott Morrison (Prime Minister of Australia since 24 August 2018) portfolios.”\n@AnonOpsSE, another prominent representative of the Anonymous collective tweeted that “Enlace Hacktivista has released 285,635 emails (82 GB) from the Nauru Police Force, documenting conditions of the island and abuses endured by asylum-seekers and refugees.”\nAt the time of publishing this article, there was no comment from the Nauru Police Force or Australian authorities.\nAnonymous Hits Russian Ministry of Culture- Leaks 446GB of Data\nThe trove of leaked data is now available on the official website of DDoSecrets, while Anonymous vows to target more Russian entities in the coming days.\nThe Anonymous hacktivists collective has targeted the Russian Ministry of Culture and leaked 446 GB worth of data online. The cyberattack was carried out as part of the collective’s ongoing operation OpRussia against the country’s invasion of Ukraine.\nAnonymous, as we know it, is a group of hacktivists that announced a cyberwar against Russia after the country invaded Ukraine in late February 2022. The latest to suffer a data leak is Russia’s Ministry of Culture. As seen by Hackread.com, the group has leaked 446 GB of data stolen from the ministry.\nOne of the Anonymous representatives on Twitter (@YourAnonTV) also confirmed the attack in their tweet.\nAccording to Emma Best, journalist, and co-founder of a non-profit whistleblower organization DDoSecretsDistributed Denial of Secrets, aka DDoSecrets, the enormous data dump is now available on their official website. \nThe organization also analyzed the data revealing that among other information it also includes 30,000 emails from the Russian Culture Ministry (Министерство культуры Российской Федерации). The ministry manages state policy about cinematography, art, copyright, archives, censorship, and cultural heritage.\nSince the beginning of the Ukraine and Russia conflict, Anonymous and its affiliates have published more than 700 GB of data claimed to be stolen from the Russian government entities. Here is an updated list of the entities targeted under Anonymous-backed #OpRussia.\nSource- DDoSecrets\nAround 150 GB of data was leaked after Blagoveshchensk hacking, and 116 GB of emails from the Tver region governor and administration have been leaked. Anonymous claims to have access to at least 600,000 emails from the 712GB of data from these entities. Since the beginning of the way, Anonymous has claimed to have posted over 2 million Russian emails online.\nIt is no secret that Anonymous is standing strong with Ukraine over the ongoing conflict between the two countries. The collectives have so far targeted both the government and the private sector to spread their message.\nThe list and timeline of some of the cyberattacks reported by Hackread.com on the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine are as follow:\nAnonymous Affiliate NB65 Breach State-Run Russian Broadcaster; Leak 786GB of Data\nThe data leaked by the Anonymous affiliate group contains 4,000 files and more than 900,000 emails from Russian state-run television and radio broadcaster VGTRK (aka All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company).\nNB65 (Network Battalion 65) is a hacker group linked with the Anonymous hacktivist collective. The group claims to have breached the servers of Russian state-run television and radio broadcaster called the “All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company” (VGTRK).\nAnonymous’ Twitter account (@YourAnonTV) also tweeted about the hack on their handle this week, revealing that hackers have leaked around 800 GB of data online.\nAnonymous-linked group ‘NB65’ ( @xxNB65 ) released via #DDoSecrets over 20 years and 900K emails from VGTRK, a Russian, state-owned broadcaster which operates 5 national TV stations, 2 international networks, 5 radio stations, and over 80 regional TV and radio networks.\nVGTRK is Russia’s largest media corporation and manages dozens of national and regional television and radio stations and online channels in Russia and other languages. According to NB65, they hacked the All-Russia State TV a few days after Anonymous announced hacking of the Central Bank of Russia and leaked 22GB worth of data online.\nAccording to a tweet from Emma Best, journalist, and co-founder of a non-profit whistleblower organization DDoSecrets, the data provided by the hackers is more than 800 GB, and the total comes to 786.2GB after “de-duplication” and sorting.\nBest wrote that apart from over 900,000 emails, the data contains more than 4,000 documents stolen from VGTRK’s cloud service. The files mostly comprise media clips and assets. It is worth noting that its primary assets include TV channels Russia-1, Russia 24, and RTR Planeta.\nOn the other hand, @YourAnonNews, one of the largest social media representatives of the Anonymous movement urged people to download the data from the DDoSecrets website via torrent and translate the leaked emails.\nIt is no secret that Anonymous is standing strong with Ukraine over the ongoing conflict between the two countries. The collectives have so far targeted both the government and the private sector to spread their message.\nOn March 26th, 2022, Anonymous not only confirmed breaching the Central Bank of Russia, but also leaked 28GB worth of banking data via DDoSecrets. The list and timeline of some of the cyberattacks reported by Hackread.com on the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine are as follow:\nConfirmed: Anonymous Hacks Central Bank of Russia; Leaks 28GB of Data\nOne of the Anonymous affiliate groups going by the Twitter handle of @Thblckrbbtworld has leaked 28GB worth of Central Bank of Russia data in support of Ukraine.\nAnonymous hacktivist collective has announced hacking the Central Bank of Russia (aka the Bank of Russia), Hackread.com can now confirm. The hack was conducted under Operation “OpRussia” to mark a protest against the Russian attack on Ukraine.\nAs a result, the group, particularly one of the Anonymous affiliate groups who goes by the Twitter handle of @Thblckrbbtworld, has leaked 28GB worth of Central Bank’s data which is now available for public download.\nOn the other hand, Distributed Denial of Secrets (aka DDoSecrets), a non-profit whistleblower organization has also announced archiving the entire data on its official website earlier today.\nOn Twitter, @YourAnonNews, one of the largest social media representatives of the Anonymous movement also confirmed the hack stating that “Russian Central Bank hack is confirmed and will be released soon via DDoSecrets.”\nIt is worth noting that on March 23rd, 2022, Anonymous had claimed to hack the Central Bank of Russia and steal 35,000 files. The group went on to claim “We have your economic secrets now, you will tremble with fear, Putin.” To verify their initial claims the group had also tweeted copies of banking documents in the Russian language.\nThe Central Bank of Russian Federation leak (28 GB) has been published by Anonymous. We distributed these documents to various points of the internet. If the links are censored, we will share them on different links.\nHackread.com has seen the leaked data however due to its humongous size, it was virtually and physically impossible to scan each file\/folder. Nevertheless, our limited analysis shows that the exposed records included years’ worth of financial records with some documents going as far back as 1999.\nFurthermore, invoices, internal communication, documents, memos, bank statements, names of shareholders of various banks, bank licenses, names, addresses of apparently high-profile customers\/clients, etc. are part of the leaked records.\nNote: A detailed analysis will be published based on the findings of DDoSecrets in the coming days.\n  MESSAGE FROM #ANONYMOUS RABBIT:“People shouldn’t be afraid of their government, governments should be afraid of their people.”The Central Bank of Russian Federation leak (28 GB) has been published by Anonymous  #Ukraine #OPRussia   pic.twitter.com\/BJJBMpZESZ— The Black Rabbit World (@Thblckrbbtworld) March 25, 2022\nFor your information, the Central Bank of Russia is responsible for monetary policy and ensuring the functioning of the payment system in the Russian Federation. The bank is also responsible for protecting the stability of the national currency, the ruble. Therefore any attack on its networks could be devastating for the country and its currency.\nIt is no secret that Anonymous has sided with Ukraine over the ongoing conflict between two countries. The group has so far targeted the government and the private sector to spread its message.\nA couple of weeks ago, the group hacked Roskomnadzor (aka Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media), a major Russian federal agency. The group also leaked over 360,000 files via DDoSecrets.\nThe list and timeline of some of the cyberattacks reported by Hackread.com on the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine are as follow:\nAnonymous Leaks 79GB of Russian Oil Pipeline Giant’s Email Data\nAnonymous claims it breached Omega Company which is the in-house R&D unit of Transneft, the largest oil pipeline company in the world based in Moscow, Russia.\nAs Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues, hacktivist groups especially those affiliated with Anonymous, are targeting key state-backed organizations in Russia almost every day. Their latest victim is Transneft, a Moscow, Russia-based state-controlled pipeline transport company. Transneft is also known as the largest oil pipeline company in the world.\nOn Thursday, March 17, 2022, Distributed Denial of Secrets (aka DDoSecrets), a non-profit whistleblower organization, announced receiving a whopping 79GB worth of emails belonging to Transneft’s research and development division called Omega.\nOn Twitter, @YourAnonNews, one of the largest social media representatives of the Anonymous movement also acknowledged the hack.\nIt is worth noting that originally the data was shared with DDoSecrets by Anonymous hacktivists and the organization itself is not behind the hack or leak.\nAccording to the details shared by DDoSecrets, the email leaks contain the email accounts data of company employees. The data doesn’t just include email messages but also sensitive files such as invoices and product shipment information.\nThere are image files as well that show equipment configurations and server racks. The Verge reported that some of the emails it examined to authenticate were as recent as 15th March. DDOSecrets noted that the attachments part of the leak could contain malware.\nFor your information, Transneft is a Russian state-controlled oil pipeline firm. It is the world’s largest oil pipeline company and the latest to join the list of companies blocked from dealing with US market investors as per the terms of sanctions against Russia.\nThe Omega Company is its in-house R&D unit responsible for producing advanced temperature monitoring and acoustic systems for oil pipelines.\nAs you may already know Russia has come under the radar of hacktivists, particularly the Anonymous collective, after the country invaded Ukrainian territories on February 24th, 2022. Since then, Russian IT infrastructure is being targeted every other day including government websites, State-run TV channels, online video streaming platforms, etc.\nust last week, the group hacked Roskomnadzor (aka Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media), a major Russian federal agency. The group also leaked over 360,000 files via DDoSecrets.\nHowever, the group’s most significant attack took place last week when one of its affiliates hacked over 400 surveillance cameras in Russia. The hacktivists then defaced the compromised cameras with messages against President Putin and in support of Ukraine.\nThe second attack, which is ongoing, is being set up by Squad303, a newly formed digital army comprising Anonymous-associated programmers. In the first stage of the attack, the group sent out 7 million text messages to random Russian citizens across the country urging them to protest against the Russian attack on Ukraine.\nDetails of both attacks are available here.\nAnonymous sent 7 million texts to Russians plus hacked 400 of their security cams\nAnonymous and its affiliate groups have sent 7 million text messages to Russian citizens about the war in Ukraine while another group has hacked 400+ security cameras in the country with anti-war messages.\nAnonymous hacktivists are claiming to have hacked into hundreds of public surveillance cameras installed across Russia to post messages against the Russian president Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and in support of Ukraine.\nIt is worth noting that the hacktivists originally announced the hack on March 7th however at the time of publishing this article, most targeted cameras were still compromised and displaying content left by the group.\nAccording to Anonymous, the group has compromised more than 400 security cameras in Russia and displayed anti-propaganda messages. The hacktivist collective has also compiled live feeds from 100+ Russian CCTV cameras and posted them on the newly launched website .\nApart from running live feeds of compromised security cameras; the website also explains why these cameras were hacked and how Anonymous supports Ukraine in the ongoing conflict between two countries.\nThe point of this leak is solely to spread information to the Russian people, and potentially (although unlikely) use these cameras for recon. Since most of these cameras are in deep Russia (and some near the border cities of Ukraine), this is mainly a large anti-propaganda movement. We are however working on cameras in Belarus, Ukraine, and closer to the Ukraine conflict in Russia, that will be used entirely for Recon for the Ukrainian military. That dump will come next.\nThe group claims it is trying to hack security cameras in Belarus, Ukraine, and regions closer to the Russian border and will use them to help the Ukrainian military conduct reconnaissance. \nAnonymous has categorized the hacked cameras into Businesses, Outdoor, Indoor, Restaurants, Offices, Schools, and Security Offices, which explains the extensiveness of hacking. In most cases, Anonymous superimposed English text messages over live feeds such as the following:\n“Putin is killing children; 352 Ukraine civilians dead; Russians lied to 200RF.com; Slava Ukraine! Hacked by Anonymous.”\nFor your information, the 200RF.com website is set up by Ukrainian Internal Affairs Ministry to allow Russian relatives to identify Russian soldiers who either captured or died during the war.\nIn another incident, Squad303, a newly formed digital army comprising Anonymous-associated programmers, sent out over 7 million SMS messages to cell phone numbers across Russia.\nThe group created a tool called 1920.in to allow non-technical individuals to contribute to #OpRussia, which is dubbed the world’s largest cyber operation to date. This campaign aimed to inform the Russian public about the war in Ukraine. Within 48 hours, the group sent out 2 million text messages, and by Tuesday, the SMS count reached 5 million.\nIn a video, Squad303 stated that they are trying to help Ukraine.\nWe have a message for the citizens of the free world: the legion is calling you. Ukraine needs you. You are the largest army in the history of the world. You don’t need any weapons or ammunition. Your weapons are smartphones and your ammo is messages sent to Russian citizens.\nAnonymous & its affiliates hacked 90% of Russian misconfigured databases\nA new report reveals that since the Russian attack on Ukraine, Anonymous and its affiliate groups have compromised 90% of misconfigured cloud databases owned by different Russian organizations.\nAs you may already know that Russia has come under the radar of hacktivists, particularly the Anonymous collective, after the country invaded Ukrainian territories on February 24th, 2022. Since then, Russian IT infrastructure is being targeted every other day including government websites, State-run TV channels, online video streaming platforms, etc.\nBut now, researchers have revealed that hackers launched a large-scale cyberattack on misconfigured and exposed cloud databases owned by different Russian organizations. The severity of the attack can be quantified by the fact that around 90% of these databases have been compromised by hackers.\nAccording to the IT security researchers at Website Planet, Anonymous and its affiliate group of hackers compromised around 90% of Russian cloud databases that were exposed to the public without any security authentication or password.\nAlthough there is no clarity over whether the data was downloaded or not and what the hackers intend to do with it chances are bright that they might use it for additional attacks.\nAccording to Jeremiah Fowler of Security Discovery who collaborated with Website Planet to complied this report, out of Russia’s 100 exposed cloud databases that they discovered through different tools and sources, at least 92 were compromised.\nIn most cases, attackers fully erased the dataset with a MeowBot-inspired script. One of these databases belonged to the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States). Also, part of the compromised information was a dataset belonging to Russian ISP Green Dot that contained a large number of secret keys having mail.ru as the host server.\nFowler further revealed that the files stored in the compromised databases were either removed or renamed with pro-Ukrainian messages, most of which read:\n“Putin stop this war,” “no war,” and “HackedByUkraine.”\nApart from the hack, the database may have exposed weak administrative credentials and emails, making employees potential targets of social engineering attacks to “gain access deeper in the organization of social engineering,” Fowler noted.\nIdentifying unsecured databases isn’t as a big deal as it seems. With only a few taps, search engines like Shodan or Censys can constantly scan the internet and open databases with default logins effortlessly.\nHowever, the fact that hackers are using these databases for hacktivism is something never seen before. Nevertheless, researchers warn that as an unsuspected user one should keep an eye on their data whether it is involved in a data breach or left exposed due to misconfigured databases.\nA MeowBot or Meow attack is a type of attack in which the bot searches for unsecured databases and deletes them entirely without any explanation. Previously, UFO VPN had its database compromised and wiped out by MeowBot.\nA misconfiguration occurs when an administrator or company leaves their database open to public access without any password or security authentication. These databases are easy to access through different search engines and often store a massive trove of sensitive and personal data.\nAs of July 2020, 9,517 unsecured databases were identified with more than 10 billion records globally. At that time, 51% of the databases were exposed on Elasticsearch while 49% were on MongoDB.\nAnonymous hacked Russian TV and streaming services with Ukraine war footage\nAccording to Anonymous, three Russian-state TV channels, Russia 24, Moscow 24, and Channel One and two Netflix-like Russian streaming services, Ivi and Wink, were targeted in the attack.\nThe popular hacking collective Anonymous claims to have hacked streaming services and several state TV channels in Russia to air footage of the war in Ukraine. The latest cyber attack came just a week after the group interrupted transmissions of several State TV channels in Russia to play the Ukrainian national anthem.\nOn the evening of March 6th, 2022, Anonymous took to Twitter to post footage of the alleged hacking of Russian state TV. According to Anonymous, three Russian-state TV channels, Russia 24, Moscow 24, and Channel One and two Netflix-like Russian streaming services, Ivi and Wink, were targeted in the cyberattack. The footage was posted with the following caption:\nThe hacking collective #Anonymous today hacked into the Russian streaming services Wink and Ivi (like Netflix) and live TV channels Russia 24, Channel One, Moscow 24 to broadcast war footage from #Ukraine #OpRussia..  \nThe clip posted by Anonymous shows the skyline of a war-torn town in Ukraine, and then the footage shifts focus to a man recording footage of an unexploded Russian missile. The screen then displays an anti-war message from the group claiming that the Russian public resents this war.\n“Ordinary Russians are against the war”, the message read. Anonymous posted another tweet claiming that they have hacked all Russian state TV channels with more images of onscreen messages from the gang. “All Russian-state TV channels have been hacked.”\nThe sole objective of this hack, according to Anonymous, was to show the realities of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nHackread earlier reported that Anonymous publicly threatened Russian President Vladimir Putin after Russia invaded Ukraine in a supposed peacekeeping mission. On February 27th, 2022, the group posted a video message warning Putin of grave consequences and an upcoming cyberwar if his forces do not evacuate Ukraine.\nLater, the websites of the Russian government, the Russian defense ministry, and Russian firms like Gazprom were targeted and defaced. Shortly after, a cyberattack was launched against an EV charging station in Moscow, interrupting services at the facility.\nThe station’s screens displayed anti-Putin and anti-government messages and support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Furthermore, on March 4th, 2022, Anonymous carried out another cyber attack and defaced the official website of the Russian Space Research Institute.\nThe hacktivist group also tweeted download links claiming claims it contained data stolen from the Russian space agency Roscosmos.\nAnonymous hacks & defaces Russian Space Research Institute Website\nA prominent Twitter account (@YourAnonNews) linked to the Anonymous movement has also confirmed the hack via Twitter Thursday morning.\nWhile the Russian attack on Ukraine continues and the conflict intensifies, we have noticed a sudden surge in hacktivists launching targeted attacks against Russian infrastructure.\nLast week Hackread.com published a detailed report on how Anonymous had hacked several Russian State TV Stations and defaced their transmissions with the Ukrainian national anthem. The next day, a group of hacktivists attacked an electric vehicle charging station and interrupted its services in Moscow.\nOn Thursday, March 3rd, hacktivists from a group going by the Twitter handle of “v0g3lSec” managed to breach the website of a Russian Space Research Institute.\nHackread.com can confirm that the group defaced the website of Russia’s Space Research Institute (IKI) after breaching one of its subdomains.\nThe ISS reference hints at the Russian government’s decision to end the partnership between the Russian space agency and NASA, a move that can adversely impact the future of the International Space Station (ISS).\nAccording to reports, other subdomains of the agency remained online. However, the targeted part of the website is related to the World Space Observatory Ultraviolet project (WSO-UV), which is due to be launched in 2025.\nA prominent Twitter account (@YourAnonNews) linked to the Anonymous movement has also confirmed the hack via Twitter on Thursday morning.\nThe YourAnonNews account also shared a link to a ZIP file hosted on the Cloud platform in the subsequent tweets. The group claims it to contain data stolen from the Russian space agency Roscosmos.\nThe leaked data comprises PDFs, handwritten forms, descriptions of lunar missions, and spreadsheets. However, the authenticity of the data is yet to be confirmed.\nFor your information, the Space Research Institute of Russia designs and builds scientific equipment\/tools for space experiments.\nUniversity College London hit by a major ransomware attack\n\nOne of the world’s leading educational institution University College London (UCL) has come under a massive ransomware attack. According to reports, the attack affected the university’s IT system including student management system and shared drives.\nThe ransomware attack came weeks after the country’s National Health Service (NHS) had its IT system crippled by WannaCry ransomware attack. Although it is unclear what triggered WannaCry infection the authorities at UCL believe their system was infected through phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links.\nUCL also believe that the attack could be a zero-day attack.\nAccording to UCL’s security advisory:\n“We wanted to provide a further update on the ransomware infection we are currently experiencing at UCL. We are continuing to investigate the infection that is affecting UCL users. Our current hypothesis is that the malware infection occurred through users visiting a website that had been compromised rather than being spread via email attachments. However, this remains unconfirmed at the moment.”\nUCL, according to BBC is a “center of excellence in cybersecurity research.” This status was awarded by “The Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ),” a British intelligence and security organization but according to UCL’s information services division “its virus checkers did not show any suspicious activity or catch the attack.”\nThe incident was first reported on Wednesday afternoon around 5 pm when UCL’s network and shared drives got infected. However, the University College London Hospitals associated with the NSH remained uninfected yet to protect it from the attack the authorities purposely suspended their NHS email system.\nIt is unclear what type of ransomware has targeted the UCL but the attack on its servers came the same day when Microsoft released a rare update to patch security flaws in its Windows OS to protect users from WannaCry like attacks.\nRemember, WannaCry ransomware infection started from NHS hospitals and spread to more than 150 countries and affected 200,000 victims. The attack used NSA hacking tools leaked by ShadowBrokers hacking group. During the attack, the malware took advantage of SMB vulnerability in Windows.\nAs for the UCL attack, there’s more to come so stay tuned.\nDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.\nIranian State TV Hacked During President’s Speech on Revolution Day\nThe Ali’s Justice (Edalat-e Ali) hacker group has claimed responsibility for hacking the live transmission of an Iranian state-run TV and radio station to disrupt and deface the speech of Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi during the Revolution Day ceremonies.\nOn February 11th, 2023, the President of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, was delivering a speech at Azadi Square in Tehran, where a massive crowd had gathered to mark the country’s 44th anniversary. It was an opportunity for the government to show its popularity, but its efforts were sabotaged by the hacktivist collective Ali’s Justice (Edalat-e Ali).\nThe hackers disrupted the State TV broadcast and instead aired the slogan “Death to Khamenei” and urged people to withdraw their money from government banks. Furthermore, they encouraged the citizens to participate in antigovernment protests, due to be held on February 16th, 2023.\nWatch as hackers from the Edalat-e Ali group interrupt the live transmission.\nThe cyberattack was also confirmed by Germany-based Iranian journalist Bamdad Esmaili on his Twitter account. On the other hand, the Edalat-e Ali group used its Telegram channel to announce the hack. In a statement seen by Hackread.com, the group claimed responsibility for hacking TV and radio transmissions.\n“We the Adalat Ali group hacked the Islamic Republic of Iran’s TV and Radio transmission. First of all, the Adalat Ali group offers its condolences to the entire freedom-loving nation on the decade of dawn and the impure arrival of Khomeini the executioner to Iran.”\nIt is worth noting that Edalat-e Ali is a prominent group of hacktivists who have been working against the Iranian government for the past few years. Some of their recent hacks have involved the interruption of Iran State-Run TV’s live transmission in October 2022.\nIn August 2021, the same group breached the computer system and security cameras at a prison facility in northern Tehran, resulting in the leaking of live footage of the grim conditions and grave human rights abuses taking place inside.\nIran has been rattled by cyberattacks since September 2022, when Anonymous hacktivists launched Operation OpIran to support Iranians protesting against the death of 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian Masha Amini.\nAmini died while under detention by Tehran’s morality police, called the Guidance Patrol. She was arrested for wearing her hijab improperly.\nAmini’s death sparked clashes between authorities and protestors, resulting in arrests and deaths. The latest hack from the Edalat-e Ali group was also part of its support for the protestors in Iran.\nNevertheless, the Iranian government vows to tackle protesters, while hacktivists from different parts of the world aim at the country’s critical infrastructure.\nAnonymous hacks ISIS website; infecting users with malware\nAmaq, the official news agency of ISIS or Daesh terrorist group is informing its users about a potential compromise in the security of its website. According to them, the site has been hacked by Anonymous hackers and is now infecting thousands of users.\nWhen visiting the site, the following message keeps appearing: “The site ahead contains malware, and that attacker might attempt to install dangerous programs on your computer that steal or delete your information.”\nMore: Hacker gets 20 years in prison for sharing US military data with ISIS\nIt seems that site’s administrators had identified the hack on Thursday, told the media through a telegram channel and warned users not to download the flash player appearing on the site. They said “Please be warned,” as the request to download flash player will result in the compromise of users devices.\nVocativ reports that several ISIS forums have also reported about the incident, and according to a few forum users, the virus was impersonating as a Flashplayer.apk. APK (Android package kit), an Android operating system file format. They further claimed that the malware is designed to spy on the ISIS terrorist group’s members and that the malware could track user’s locations, read conversations and collect all the multimedia files on the user’s device.\nSince the virus disguised as a Flash Player APK file, thousands of users are supposedly compromised. One user also suggested that to get rid of the malware, one needs to reset the device to factory settings.\nSo far, no group has claimed the responsibility of the hack, but it is believed that could be an anti-ISIS group running operation ISIS, #OPISIS is behind this hack. The people behind #OPISIS- an anonymous- affiliated anti-ISIS online campaign have been known to disrupt the ISIS’ online presence over the past few years. The fact that hackers left a message stating “We are coming for you,” could confirm that they are behind the hack.\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/Di5s3nSi0N_1\/status\/847062038765559809\nMore: Anonymous Deface ISIS Twitter Accounts with Pornographic Content\nRemember, this is not the first time.

The website was defaced not once but twice where hackers left a deface page along with a message explaining why they have been targeted the site.\nThe reason for targeting Boa Esporte was its recent initiative of hiring goalkeeper Bruno Fernandes das Dores de Souza who was sent to prison for not only brutally murdering his ex-girlfriend and mother of his kid Eliza Samudio in 2010 but also feeding her to his dogs.\nFernandes, more famous by his first name Bruno was sentenced to prison for 22 years, but due to a legal technicality, he was released last month after which Boa Esporte hired him. Bruno still claims to be innocent. However, the hacker community thought otherwise and decided to hack Esporte’s website with messages like “Has Bruno told where is Eliza’s body?”.\nThe site was then hacked for the second time in one day with messages against domestic violence against women in Brazil. The hackers also left pictures of Bruno and Eliza as a deface page along with statistics of women in Brazil killed since 2013.\nThe picture of Bruno is a magazine cover in which he’s urging people to “Let him play” while the picture of Eliza is a result of photoshop in which she’s shown saying “I would like to see my son grow.”\nSite oficial do Boa Esporte é hackeado após contratação do goleiro Bruno #globoesporte https:\/\/t.co\/FZpFPACmbi\n— Boa Esporte Clube (@Boa_Esporte) March 12, 2017\n\nIn must be noted that hackers are not the only community criticizing the hiring of Bruno. In fact, people on social media in Brazil also opposed the decision urging companies to stop sponsoring Boa Esporte. As a result, the food supplementing company Nutrends broke off its sponsorship of the club.\nAnother sponsor, Cardiocenter Varginha which provides medical evaluation services for Boa Esporte players, has also canceled its contract after the cyber attack and criticism. The company issued a statement on its official Facebook page saying it had requested that the brand should be removed from the club’s official website.\nAt the time of publishing this article, Boa Esporte website was down and unreachable for users. As far as Bruno, according to BBC, he’s still playing for Boa Esporte, seems like the club won’t back down from its decision.\nDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.\nBlue Whale Challenge: Anonymous Urges Teens to Quit Playing Suicide Game\nA group of hacktivists connected to the online hacktivist group Anonymous is urging teens to quit taking part in a sinister game called Blue Whale Challenge. Since last year, this game has gained popularity in Russia and as a result, 130 teens have reportedly committed suicide.. (Editors note: HackRead has so far been unable to independently confirm the exact number.)\nBlue Whale Challenge requires teens to accomplish weird tasks for 50 days straight such as harming themselves, sleeping and waking up at odd times, watching explicit and horror movies. Upon completing these tasks, these teens are told to kill themselves which unfortunately allegedly has caused deaths of possibly as many as hundreds of teens in Russia.\nMore: Youth Kills self after losing League of Legends game online\nHurting oneself is the core part of this game Just last week, two girls were found dead after falling from a 14-story apartment. Serbian Times report that Yulia Konstantinova, 15, and Veronika Volkova, 16, were likely playing the Blue Whale’ suicide game\nWhile the investigations are still ongoing in Russia, the trend is still gaining momentum in the country with the help of social media platforms which are being used to promote the game. For example, Yulia Konstantinova posted a picture of a Blue Whale Challenge on her Instagram account before killing herself.\nIn another case, the local police in a Russian town received an unknown call alerting them about a student who recently joined the game and planning to kill herself on the instruction of game’s administrator. The police were quick to react and rescued the girl who later confessed to being the part of the game but did not plan to kill herself. \nThere have been several other cases involving Blue Whale Challenge’ suicide challenge including one which resulted in the arrest of 21-year-old Philipp Budeikinan, an alleged administrator of the game after which there was a slight decrease in the whole process however now new cases have emerged where vulnerable teens are reportedly found taking part in the game.\nNovaya Gazeta, a Russian newspaper reported that “We have counted 130 suicides of children that took place between November 2015 to April 2016. Almost all these children were members of the same internet groups and lived in good, happy families.” (Editors note: HackRead have seen reports indicating that so far 15 of these suicides have been officially attributed to the game itself.) \nThere is a Blue Whale game, I do not see any reason to play it, since I decided to commit suicide, so act now.\n— BlackGirl (@BlaCk_GirL047) February 17, 2017\n\nAlthough reports cover the incident in Russia the Anonymous hacker group is urging teens on the social media to stay away from such groups and people willingly or being forced to play this game. In an exclusive conversation with one of the Anonymous hacktivist, HackRead was told that:\n“We launch that operation #OpBluewhale to save all children in Europe from that dangerous game. Behind of that game is Russian, Romanian criminals. We have found all moderators of that game, and we have all the information about the moderators. We will destroy that game. We have already saved a lot of children from suicide.”\nAnonymous also shared exclusive screenshot in which they gave in-depth explaining how teens are being threatened to become the part of this game. \n\nCurrently, Anonymous claims they have identified some administrators involved in the game and also spoken with the kids and saved some lives. The hacktivists vow to hunt down the culprits and mastermind of the whole while at the same time they are urging teens not to become part of such online games and report anyone bullying them online or forcing them to get involved in such sinister activities.\nRead more about this game on AOL, UK’s Metro and Serbian Times.\nAnonymous shut down thousands of Dark Web sites for hosting child porn\nAnonymous, as you may know, is a notorious group of hacktivists having footprints across the web including the Dark Web, where all sorts of illegal activities like child pornography and drug dealing are carried out secretively. It is a widely-known fact that Anonymous is a dedicated group that always targets and attacks service providers, organizations and institutions that somehow negate or violate human rights. So, when anonymous got a hint about the child porn services on the Dark Web, there was bound to be some fireworks.\nReportedly, the Anonymous-affiliated hacker group has managed to take down the Freedom Hosting II servers affecting more than 10,000 websites. It must be noted that Freedom Hosting II is regarded as one of the largest hosting services on the Dark Web with hosting rights of around 20% of all the sites on this underground platform. According to researcher Sarah J Lewis, the websites bear the domain .onion and therefore, can be accessed through Tor browser. The stolen information includes email IDs of more than 380,000 users.\nMust Read: Pedophiles Using Anonymous Symbolic Mask To Trap Children\nAfter the targeted hacking, whoever visited these websites was welcomed by this message:\nThe Freedom Hosting II databases were stolen and the websites being hosted by the service were defaced. Hackers demanded ransom in exchange for the data although a small amount of data had already been leaked online on another website that was being hosted through the Tor network. The information was revealed by Troy Hunt, the owner of the breach notification website HaveIBeenPwned.\nAnonymous also posted a message informing users that all the data has been copied and dumped online. This includes 74GB of files and a 2.3GB database. It was also noted in the message that the data dump also includes private keys. Furthermore, the dumped data includes plain text emails, usernames and hashed passwords.\nThe only reason behind the targeting of this hosting service was that Anonymous is strictly against facilitating or offering child pornography. The hacktivists associated with Anonymous or any other associated groups show zero tolerance when it comes to child porn. \nAs per the hackers, more than half of the files hosted by Freedom Hosting II servers were linked to child porn. Since child pornography is illegal, therefore, Anonymous believes that it has carried out a social service by attacking the server.\nHowever, this is not the first time when Anonymous has done something like this. In 2015, the hacktivists shut down world’s largest x-rated animal abuse forum and also deleted several animal abuse websites from the Internet.\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

This time the group has targeted the Thai government job portal by leaking personal and sensitive details of officials and job seekers.\nThe data which has been leaked on the dark web has been divided into several links and upon scanning HackRead found it to be legit and never been leaked on the Internet before. The data includes website’s databases, names, surnames, names of companies where the job seeker has applied to, payment details, phone numbers, bank account numbers, emails and encrypted passwords.\nThe domain targeted by Anonymous is job.*.go.th assigned to each government department with their respective sub-domain. In this case, the data has been stolen from Revenue Department, The Administrative Court, Fine Arts Department, Department of Cooperative Auditing, e Provincial waterworks authority, Public Debt Management Office, Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Ministry of information and communications technology, Ministry of Foreign affairs and several other departments of Thai government.\nThe total number of leaked accounts goes in thousands but at the moment HackRead can’t verify exactly how many accounts have been leaked however it must be noted that leaked data is only 1% of total files stolen from the portal. It should also be noticed that Anonymous refrained from leaking contact and family details of job seekers, for instance, HackRead was told that the group has not leaked job seekers’ ID numbers, addresses and names of their parents.\nThe reason given by Anonymous for not leaking the aforementioned details was that the group wants to fight the “Thai Regime” not the citizens.\n“We have fought for human, animal and green rights. We have tried to increase public awareness. People have to fight for their rights. We haven’t hacked and fought for ourselves to be famous or to get attention on ourselves. We have done that to get attention on all kind issues. We invite people to fight for their rights. They can be late if they don’t start fighting for their rights “now,” said Anonymous.\nRemember, Anonymous has been conducting cyber attacks on Thai government since 2015 under operation OpSingleGateway to fight the Internet surveillance law. Since then, the group has successfully hacked Thai Police, government Telecom firm, Thai LA consulate, Royal Navy and ministry of foreign affairs.\nAt the time of publishing this article, the leaked data was available for anyone to download.\nHacker Claims Breach of FBI’s Webserver; Plone CMS Calls It a Hoax\nA hacker going by the online handle of “CyberZeist” has claimed to have hacked the content management system (CMS) of the official website of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the mainstream investigation agency of the United States.\nThe hacker claims he compromised the Plone CMS system used by the bureau to obtain login credentials of FBI officers. The hacker has openly dedicated the hack attack to “the Anonymous Movement,” and says that numerous sources have contacted him so far for buying the vulnerability that led to the exploit but he has declined it so far.\nThrough the hack, CyberZeist claims to steal login information of around 155 officials. The information includes encrypted passwords and email addresses along with the usernames which are now available for Pastebin.\nAccording to information posted by the hacker on Twitter, he managed to hack the Plone CMS of FBI’s website on 22nd December 2016, through exploiting a zero-day vulnerability, which was already identified by someone else. This zero-day is already on sale on the underground forums on the Dark Web via Tor, says CyberZeist.\nThe hacker stated that, “While exploiting FBI.GOV, it was clearly evident that their webmaster had a very lazy attitude as he\/she had kept the backup files (.bck extension) on that same folder where the site root was placed (Thank you Webmaster!), but still I didn’t leak out the whole contents of the backup files, instead I tweeted out my findings and thought to wait for FBI’s response.”\nCyberZeist also noted that this vulnerability is also pretty useful for some other organizations such as the Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center and the EU Agency for Network Information. It is worth nothing that Plone CMS is Open Source software that facilitates Content Management. The FBI uses this software for hosting its official website.\nTo prove that he actually hacked into the CMS of FBI’s website and leaked the data online, CyberZeist posted various screenshots on Twitter. In the screenshots, everything from gaining unauthorized access to the server to the hacking of the database was shown. CyberZeist used zero-day vulnerability, which was a local file inclusion type flaw that affected the python plugins.\nAccording to the hacker, the FBI opted for a VM to host the site and this prevented him from gaining root privileges, but, he did manage to get some information about the server including information about software and when was the last time that the site underwent a reboot. He further explained that the FBI used a FreeBSD version 6.2_RELEASE with custom configurations, which was launched in 2007.\nHowever, in a blog post, Plone has denied the breach and called it a “hoax”. The firm also stated that its security team is aware of a recent claim and has thoroughly examined it and determining that it is a hoax since there is no zero-day flaw in Plone nor in Plone-based distributions.\nAnonymous Hacks, Defaces Bilderberg Group Website Against World Crisis\nThe online hacktivist group Anonymous along with their counterparts from HackBack movement have hacked and defaced the official website of The Bilderberg Group also known as Bilderberg Club, Bilderberg meetings and Bilderberg conference, an annual private conference of 120 to 150 people of the North American and European political elite, media personalities, industrial and finance giants established in 1954.\nThe hackers left a deface page along with a brief message explaining the reason for defacing the site and criticizing the role of “political elite” for the problems faced by “common people.” The message also criticized the role of Bilderberg group for planning wars for personal interests. The hackers also warned the group members to start working for human beings and their benefits rather than personal interests or expect more hacks since “they” the hackers will be watching them.\n“Dear Bilderberg members, from now, each one of you has 1 year (365 days) to truly work in favor of humans and not your private interests. Each TopIc you discuss or work you achieve through Your uber private meetings should from now benefit world population and not X or Y group of people otherwise, we will find you and we will hack you,” according to the message.\nHere is a full preview of the deface page left by Anonymous and HackBack movement:\n\nIf you are not aware of the HackBack hacker and their movement then HackBack also goes by the online handle of “Phineas Phisher” “Hack Back!” and “@GammaGroupPR” who came in the news some months ago after donating around €10,000 (about £8,000) Bitcoin to a Kurdish anticapitalist group “Rojava Plan” that is based in Rojava.\nThe hacker then hacked the Catalan Police Union server and leaked highly sensitive data against police brutality. The same hacker then hacked Spanish Police server and ended up leaking personal details of police officers against the infamous Gag Law. Remember, it was the same law that forced a woman to pay a fine of 800 euros\/$889 for uploading a picture on Facebook showing a police car parked in a disabled spot.\nAs far as the Bilderberg group, this is not the first time when Anonymous hacktivists have successfully targeted their website. In June 2016, the group conducted a DDoS attack on Bilderberg Group website forcing the site to stay offline for hours when the group was having a meeting in Germany!\nAt the time of publishing this article, the targeted website was still hacked with defacing page uploaded by the hackers.\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

The suspects were arrested about three days ago but in an exclusive conversation with Anonymous hackers behind these cyber attacks, they told HackRead that the suspects had nothing to do with DDoS attacks on the Thai ruling party and neither did they have anything to do with the data leak. The hacktivists also claimed that they are not even in Thailand.\nAs far as their latest hack is concerned the message left by Anonymous clearly shows the anger among the hacktivist community. Here’s a full preview of the deface page:  \nOther than the defacement, Anonymous also leaked data from the hacked Consulate website that includes names, emails, ID card details, phone number etc of 900 people. However, to protect the privacy of civilians hackers have only leaked names and emails.\nRemember, the protests against Internet surveillance law goes back to 2015 when Anonymous hacked the Thai police server and leaked a trove of data. Before that, the same hackers leaked sensitive data from a state-owned telecom company CAT Telecom Plc and vowed to never back down from the protest.\nAt the time of publishing this article, the targeted site was restored and available online.\nThai Police Arrest 9 Suspects Behind Cyber Attacks on Gov’t Sites\nLast week HackRead reported on the Thailand government passing a cyber-scrutiny law that was being criticized by hacktivists ever since it was being drafted back in 2015. To protest aginst the law Anonymous and its Thai counterparts have been conducting a series of cyber attacks including DDoS attacks and data leaks on prominent government and defense institution.\nTheir last attack came in shape of a massive data leak in which personal details including ID cards, copies of employee records from Thai ministry of foreign affair and the Royal Navy were leaked. But, things have now turned sour for the hacktivists as Thai authorities have detained nine people suspected of carrying out hack attacks on government websites out of which one has already been charged for breaking the cyber crime law.\nThai Police spokesperson Dejnarong Suthicharnbancha told Reuters that “The rest remain in custody and are being processed in accordance with the law.”\nIn an exclusive conversation with Anonymous hackers behind OpSingleGateway, HackRead was told that “DDoS attacks are not hacking so hacking charges, in this case, are nonsense because we did the hacking and we are behind the data leak, not those who are arrested and we are not even in Thailand. We will hit back at the Thai government over these arrests and they should expect us once again.”\nThe operation OpSingleGateway was launched last year when Anonymous hacked State-owned Telecom Firm and leaked a trove of data against the same law. The attackers then DDoSed Asia Pacific Telecommunity against Internet censorship in Asia and especially in Thailand. That’s not all, Thai Police server also came under the wrath of hackers against the very same Internet surveillance law.\nIt will be interesting to see how the Anonymous community reacts to the arrest of these suspects.

The project has received immense criticism from civil society and internet activist groups alike.\nTo protest against the law, the hacktivist group is claiming to have leaked personal details including official and National ID cards of more than 3000 employees from MFA and TICA. Upon scanning the data we found 676 files containing .png files and one Pdf file with 1072 pages filled with what looks like names and ID cards numbers in the Thai language. However, due to the language barrier, it is impossible to confirm whether the Pdf file has sensitive data or not.\n\nAnonymous is also claiming to have gotten their hands on even more sensitive data which will be leaked in the coming days. The hacktivists are also urging Thai citizens to stand against the cyber security laws that apparently is against the freedom of speech in the country.\nStatement released by Anonymous:\n“The conditions that are necessary for an open, tamper-free internet are systematically attacked within the kingdom of Thailand, and we will not sit idly by, and watch another nation construct a Great Firewall, as China has done to keep its citizens from experiencing the competing viewpoints and ideologies that make up a free and open discourse online. The Thai military junta wants to centralize and ultimately control the means with which the Thai people will be able to access the internet. This will enable them to monitor, censor or even disable internet communications in and out of Thailand.”\n“If you are a Thai citizen, understand that your data, the records of the websites you access, or who you speak with online, and what you say to them, is not safe in the possession of your government. How do we know this? Because their data is not safe from Anonymous. Your government wants you to trust their motives in collecting information on your online activities, they want you to trust that they will be able to secure this data and will only use it for lawful means. They cannot guarantee any of this. If a single gateway for access to the internet outside of Thailand is created, with the inevitable accompanying databases that will contain details of traffic passing through the gateway, it will get hacked.”\n“Imagine your entire life sitting on a single, poorly secured server. Credit card and banking details, private emails to your husbands and wives, pictures of your children, every website you have ever visited, everything that makes up the most personal and private parts of your life… All open and waiting for anyone of ill-intent to steal and use however they wish. We are not trying to scare you. We are trying to highlight the risks your government wants to create for you, for your family, for your business. Under the guise of “increased security,” and “vigilance,” they will have exposed you in the most dangerous way possible to anyone who has the ability to circumvent their poorly secured servers.”Ask yourself, is this “security” going to benefit you, or benefit the government that refuses to acknowledge the criticisms and concerns of its citizenry?”\n“We are with you, we want to show you the risks to your liberty and privacy, take a stand and tell your government that this is wrong for the people of Thailand. To prove our point, we are demonstrating the inability of the Thai government to secure even their own police servers. It is pitiful and should worry all of Thailand.”\nRoyal Thai Navy data:\nAlthough the Navy data is not massive, it does indicate that hackers are willing to leak anything to counter the law and achieve their target. Upon scanning the data we discovered a small portion of Navy’s database that includes names, usernames and emails of around hundred Thai navy officials.\nIt was just two days ago when Anonymous conducted a series of DDoS attacks on Thai government websites against the same law. During the attack, the group successfully shut down official website of ruling junta party, National Security Guard website, the web page of the Ministry of Digital Economy, Thai Police and the National Intelligence Agency.\nDDoS attacks are increasing, calculate the cost and probability of a DDoS attack on your business with this DDoS Downtime Cost Calculator.\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

Russia, the European Court of Human Rights warned that the laws governing the country’s System for Operative Investigative Activities surveillance system didn’t offer sufficient and impactful guarantees against arbitrariness and abuse of any secret surveillance system, urging Kremlin to circumvent the legal authorization requirements.\nThe passage of the Yarovaya Law in 2016 allowed authorities to obtain communication information without needing a court order.\nThe alleged data reveals how the Russian government apparently spies on its citizens’ internet and phone usage, and exclusive details of the yet-undisclosed Green Atom surveillance program, which Anonymous claims. was operated by Russia’s Federal Security Service.\nThe data also contains records of thousands of Russian citizens who were customers of Russian corporations targeted by this program.\nAs per Anonymous, the Green Atom data provide evidence of the extent to which the Russian government abuses its legal structures, as Convex virtually captured the entire data. Anonymous also noted that they had more unreleased information on FSB’s intelligence-collecting activities.\nIn their Twitter post, Anonymous stated that the data was stolen from Convex, which led to the revelation that the company had been running a project named Green Atom involving installing and maintaining surveillance equipment for monitoring Russian citizens and private corporations’ online activities.\nThrough the Green Atom program, the government could perform wide-ranging surveillance activities, using the equipment from Convex to monitor their incoming and outgoing traffic.\nAt the time of publishing this article, the data was available on the official website of DDoSecrets.\nThe Ukraine-Russia conflict has reached a new level with Anonymous cyber attacks on Russian networks. Anonymous, the international hacktivist group that works to fight censorship and corruption, has so far claimed responsibility for several cyber and social engineering attacks against the Russian government and the private sector.\nSome of the collective’s attacks include hacking the Yandex taxi app (1), Payment processor Qiwi (2), Ministry of Culture (3), State-Run Broadcaster (4), Central Bank of Russia (5), unsecured printers (6), security cameras (7), media censoring agency Roskomnadzor (8), 90% of Russian misconfigured databases (9), TV transmissions (10), Electic vehicle charging station (11) and more.\nAnonymous Shut Down Thai Sites Against Internet Censorship, Surveillance Law\nThe government of Thailand has been under the hammer of internet activist groups since the parliament approved an amendment to the 2007 Computer Protection Law. There is strong resentment among activists because the Single Internet Gateway project will be implemented by the amended law, which was passed on Friday.\nThe Single Internet Gateway project of the military government requires scanning of the entire digital data from overseas via a junta-controlled entry point. The project has received immense criticism from civil society and internet activist groups alike.\nAfter the bill was passed into a law, the websites of the National Security Agency and the Ministry of Defense became inaccessible on Tuesday. It is being reported that six government websites, including the two mentioned above, were DDoSed including the public page of the ruling junta party, National Security Guard website and the webpage of the Ministry of Digital Economy.\nA local internet activist group has claimed the responsibility of the attacks. The group calls itself the Civilians Against Single Gateway and maintains that Anonymous, the infamous hackers collective, aided them in accomplishing the task. \nRemember, last year we exclusively reported on how Anonymous hacked Thai police server and leaked a trove of data against Internet surveillance and censorship in the country.\nHowever, the havoc that started on Monday and continued till Tuesday. Some internet activists tweeted images of internal data that belonged to Thai Police and the National Intelligence Agency, which hinted at the fact that their websites were accessed by hackers. The tweets were followed by comments from the hackers who tried to mock the agencies on their failure in securing confidential information.\nOne of the tweets read:\nThe #Thai gov wants to #police the #internet, #Thai police can’t guard their own data from #Anonymous, is your data safe with them? #พรบคอม pic.twitter.com\/S6c8jJxjHo\n— Anonymous (@blackplans) December 16, 2016\n\nWorldBulletin reports that the bill is being heavily criticized because there are various terms that violate or curb the citizens’ rights of freedom of expression. Such as, the law will punish people for “entering forged or distorted computer data or false information into a computer system that is deemed to damage people, national security, public services or infrastructure or cause public panic.” This particular section has been described by people as “too broad in scope.” Those charged with this offense will be facing a maximum jail term of 5 years as well a fine of $2,800.\nMoreover, a section of the law requires setting up of a 9 member committee and giving it full authority for screening the “screen content which could breach public order or public morals even if that content does not violate the law”. The\nAnother controversial section involves the setting up a nine-member committee granted the power “to screen content which could breach public order or public morals even if that content does not violate the law.” The committee can easily seek a court order for deleting or blocking of such content.\nIt is worth noting that the bill was passed after 6 hours long debate with 168 votes in favor and 0 votes against the bill. On the other hand, before the bill was signed into a law, a petition was signed by over 360,000 internet users in Thailand protesting against the amendment and demanding to revise the bill.\nUkraine Suffers Power Outage Possibly Due to Energy Plant Hack\nLooks like hackers are hell bent on giving Ukrainians a glimpse of stone age by keep on targeting country’s power sector. In the latest, Ukraine’s national energy company has become a victim of what could be a massive cyber attack.\nUkrenergo, the national energy company, experienced power failure this Saturday. In a post on Facebook, the director of the firm Vsevolod Kovalchuk stated that the outage has mainly occurred on the northern side of Kiev and its nearby areas. According to the understanding of engineers at the company, the outage was caused by an “external interference” and the breach was materialized through “data network.”\nThe cyber-security experts were immediately handed over the task of investigating the matter and resolving the issue so that the power could be resumed. To address the issue, Ukrenergo engineers had to switch back to manual mode. The power restoration process was completed in 30 minutes whereas complete repairing of the issue was carried out within an hour and 15 minutes.\nAccording to Kovalchuk, the power outage was caused by a “failure in automation control” due to which it was mandatory to firstly convert the system on manual mode and then carry out a full restoration. Ukraine has experienced power outage previously as well when in 2015 hackers attacked the power grid of the country using BlackEnergy and KillDisk malware to infect the computers and shut down operating systems.\nIn January this year, Ukraine airport’s computer networks were also shut down after being infected with BlackEnergy Malware. In 2014, Ukraine was hit by a massive cyberattack from Russia which blocked mobile networks in the country. However, when it comes to the recent outage, it is unclear who was behind this attack.\nAnonymous Hacks Milwaukee’s Charitable Bradley Foundation Network\nThe Milwaukee-based charitable foundation has been hacked by the notorious hacker collective Anonymous.\nThe credit for this hack has been taken by famous “Anonymous Global” group by Tweeting about it this Tuesday. After posting on Twitter, the group released a letter that seemed to be sent by the Bradley Foundation administration requesting the concerned department to transfer $150 million to Hillary Clinton’s campaign.\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/AnonymousGlobo\/status\/794209944639770624\nThe hackers also leaked a trove of 30GB data which they claim belong to the foundation. But, the Bradley Foundation administration maintains that this particular document is not authentic. It is alleged that the hackers created fake documents to prove that the Clinton campaign received millions from the Bradley Foundation. However, creating 30GB of documents is not an easy job and it will require professional data scanning firm to find out if it’s real or not.\nFull list of files in the 30GB ARCHIVE https:\/\/t.co\/kBerME1cOU and screenshot of some personal information https:\/\/t.co\/45uiUZggXS Enjoy!\n— Anonymous (@AnonymousGlobo) November 2, 2016\n\nSo, more information about occupation of ppl that work in Bradley Fundation.

The group also hacked Baltimore Police Department’s server and leaked personal details of police officers for operation #OpBaltimore.\nHacker Who DDoSed Boston Hospital for OpJustina Facing Charges\nEarlier last week on Wednesday, a hacker by the name of Martin Gottesfeld was charged with targeting Boston Children’s Hospital and the Wayside Youth Family Support for a series of DDoS attacks. The Washington Times report suggests that another formal indictment will be made against him next week by the U.S Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowler. The attacks were carried out in 2014 under the name of the world-renowned hacking group Anonymous. \nAlso Read: 11 Ongoing Anonymous Operations You Must Know About\n@YourRevoCentral #OpJustina: #Anonymous Targets Boston Children’s Hospital against #JustinaPelletier custody! More ➜ http:\/\/t.co\/apVqs1LNU6\n— Hackread.com (@HackRead) April 28, 2014\n\nBackground\nGottesfeld was arrested in February 2016 by the FBI. Before this, Gottesfeld and his wife had fled and were missing but, they were later found and Gottesfeld was informed that he has been under investigation for cyber attacks that cost the Boston Children’s Hospital at least $600,000.\nA more humane purpose\nIt is not to be assumed that these attacks were simply perpetrated for the fun of it. Gottesfeld himself stated that he wanted to raise a voice against the unjust institutionalization of children. He has been against the practice of restraining children who are seemingly troubled and have an abnormal mental state. He believes that such hospitals do nothing but have those children go through a lot of sufferings.\nHe mentioned one child, in particular, a girl named Justina Pelletier who was 15-year old at the time of the attack. Gottesfeld stated that she had been treated wrongly and mentioned he had heard a number of such stories about the unjust treatment of children. Due to this, he claimed that he had launched such attacks against the hospitals as human rights activists.\nA hunger strike\nGottesfeld has been on a hunger strike since he was prosecuted and expects to spread public awareness of the issue as such. He strongly believes that the very fact the trials were not made public proves the prosecutors simply want to hide the truth from the public’s eyes.\nAnonymous Targets Italian Healthcare Sites Against ADHD Treatment\nThe Italian breach of online hacktivist group Anonymous conducted a cyber attack on four Italian healthcare websites and defaced them with a message of their own.\n\nThe attack was conducted on 21st August 2016 under the banner of operation #OpSafePharma in which Anonymous Italia and AntiSec-Italia not only did the defacement but also leaked data from two among the four targeted websites.\nMust Read: Anonymous Hit Italian Government Sites Against Trans Adriatic Pipeline Project\nThe attack was announced by Anti-Sec on their official Facebook page however it was Catalin Cimpanu of Softpedia who reported the incident first and according to his findings, Anonymous is furious over the Italian government’s stand on ADHD  (Attention-Deficit\/Hyperactivity Disorder) that reportedly includes support of heavy doses upon mildest signs.\nLeaked Data:\nThe leaked files were scanned by a cyber security company SenseCy who found out that the hacktivists leaked about 2.5 GB of data, stolen from the databases of two prominent Italian healthcare institutions, and provided links to file-sharing platforms where they uploaded the dumps. The leaked data contains documents, CVs of the physicians, administrative executives working in the facilities and personal documents of a patient who applied to be treated by a different physician.\nRelated: Anonymous Hack Italian Job Portals, Leak Trove of Data Against New Labour Laws\nAccording to SenseCy team:\nOur assessment is that this latest iteration of #OperationSafePharma originates more from a one-time opportunity window that the hacktivist group AntiSec-Italia spotted in vulnerable websites associated with Italian medical centers and hospitals, than a concerted effort by multiple Anonymous-affiliated collectives to launch a massive hacktivist campaign against the Italian healthcare sector as a whole. We base this assumption on the analysis conducted using our automated SMA (Social Media Analytics) toolset, which indicated a spike in the activity of the attackers.\nThe operation #OpSafePharma originally started in March 2016 and relaunched in June 2016 with the intention to protest against the Italian government, healthcare and pharma industry on their treatment of ADHD. Previously, the same hacktivists conducted a series of DDoS attacks on Italian healthcare websites.\nFancy Bear Hackers Leak More WADA Data; Accuse More Athletes of Doping\nIt looks like the Fancy Bear hackers are not done yet. After hacking the official website of World Anti-Doping Agency and Court of Arbitration for Sport (WADA-CAS) on Tuesday the group started leaking medical records of American athletes including gymnast Simone Biles, American basketball star Elena Delle Donne, tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams and accusing them of using banned athletic performance-enhancing drugs – commonly known as doping.\nNow, the hackers have leaked another list of sensitive documents stolen from the WADA server which includes the medical records of athletes such as Bethanie Mattek-Sands, Brittney Griner, Conger John, Dagmara Wozniak, Deanna Price, Kathleen Baker, Mcquin Baron, Michele Carter, Sam Dorman and Trevel Ivaylov Dlagnev from the United States.\nChristian Reichert, Christian Vom Lehn, Christina Obergfoll, Franziska Hentke and Robert Harting from Germany and several other athletes from countries like Romania, Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, Denmark and the United Kingdom are also included.\nThe leaked documents that are available on Fancy Bears’ website also explain the reason for conducting such a large-scale security breach:\nGreetings citizens of the world. We are Fancy Bears. We go on exposing the athletes who violate the principles of fair play by taking doping substances. The list of doping addicts includes not only the athletes of the top Olympic teams but also those who compete for other countries. We’ll keep on telling the world about doping in elite sports. Stay tuned for new leaks.\nWADA, on the other hand, had acknowledged the hack and accused Russian Tsar Team (APT28) of breaching their server, however, an hour ago the agency released another statement confirming that Fancy Bears have leaked yet another set of documents stolen from their server. \nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) confirms that, once again today, the cyber hacker Group “Fancy Bear” released a batch of confidential athlete data on their website, which they illegally obtained from a Rio 2016 Olympic Games account of WADA’s Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS). This time, they targeted eleven athletes that include three from Australia, one from Denmark, two from Germany, one from Spain and four from the United Kingdom – from the sports of boxing, cycling, rowing, shooting, swimming and tennis.\nWADA statement regarding additional data leak via Russian cyber hacker Fancy Bear: https:\/\/t.co\/aBeK1DBcgj\n— WADA (@wada_ama) September 16, 2016\n\nRussian hackers The Fancy Bears release US Olympian medial recordsPutin denies involvement but he does fancy bears. pic.twitter.com\/Re7AP5UpIp\n— Karen DaltonBeninato (@kbeninato) September 13, 2016\n\nAnonymous ‘Fancy Bears’ Hack World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Again\nA group of hackers calling themselves Anonymous Fancy Bears have claimed to hack the official website of World Anti-Doping Agency and Court of Arbitration for Sport (WADA-CAS) again and leak a trove of sensitive data on their website.\nPreviously, WADA was hacked on 12th August 2016 resulting in the leak of sensitive data including medical testing results, history, and whereabouts information of Russian Olympics whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova.\nAs far as the latest hack is concerned, the hackers claim they are part of an International hack team and stand for fair play and clean sport.\n\nAt this moment in time, the hackers did not announce their affiliation with Russia but the Bears themselves needs no reference. It’s, however, too early to say if the data is legit or not. HackRead has contacted WADA’s media team and we are awaiting their response\nAt the time of publishing; all screenshots along with their downloadable links were available on Fancy Bears’ website.\nUpdate: 7:30 PM Tuesday, September 13, 2016 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)\nIn an email to HackRead, WADA has confirmed the breach saying that,\n“The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) confirms that a Russian cyber espionage group operator by the name of Tsar Team (APT28), also known as Fancy Bear, illegally gained access to WADA’s Anti-Doping Administration and Management System (ADAMS) database via an International Olympic Committee (IOC)-created account for the Rio 2016 Games. The group accessed athlete data, including confidential medical data — such as Therapeutic Use Exemptions delivered by International Sports Federations (IFs) and National Anti-Doping Organizations (NADOs) — related to the Rio Games; and, subsequently released some of the data in the public domain, accompanied by the threat that they will release more.”\nClick here to go through WADA’s confirmation article.\nPreviously, Tsar Team (APT28) was blamed for hacking France’s TV5Mondie and running a sophisticated espionage malware campaign on fake EFF website. \nDid you enjoy reading this article?

However, the federal government tends to think otherwise, which is why Lostutter, an alleged Anonymous associate, is being tried in a federal court for four counts of felony hacking.\nIf the court finds him guilty, he may get 16 years in prison. However, the accused has pled not guilty. The trial is supposed to begin on November 8th and it will be a one week trial.\nMust Read: Anonymous Hacks and Removes X-Rated Animal Abuse Websites\nAccording to the Lostutter’s defense, the prosecutors are putting him on trial for exposing the scandal and turn a hero into a villain only because he used his right to free speech and media to expose a crime.\nLostutter told Mic the same, according to him the government “want to make an example out of me.. for exposing a cover-up.”\nLostutter is the alleged member of KnightSec, an infamous hacking group, and has already taken an active part in the hacking of Hunter Moore, the revenge-porn tycoon, and the Westboro Baptist Church hate group.\nThree years ago, the Steubenville rape scandal was exposed with the help of Lostutter. What happened was that an underage unconscious girl was sexually assaulted at school by a group of high school football players. The act was as well recorded by them.\nWhen Lostutter read about the sexual assault in the news, he immediately knew that he had to expose the perpetrators of the crime. He believed that the school’s administration was trying to cover-up the news so as to prevent the school’s reputation getting hurt. So, to expose this cover-up, he allegedly conspired to hacked the local football fan website RollRedRoll and approached another hacker Noah McHugh aka JustBatCat. With McHugh’s help, Lostutter was able to access the website and the administrators’ emails.\nAllegedly, both Lostutter and McHugh discovered emails and pictures relating to the Steubenville rape group, and thus, it became quite easy for them to join the pieces and expose those involved in the assault and also those who were trying to cover it up.\nLostutter is being tried under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which is known in the tech fraternity as an outdated, draconian law.\nAlso, it must be noted that United States’ criminal justice system is still struggling to put rapists to harsher sentences. Take the example of Stanford rapist Brock Turner, who not only received just 6 months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious girl but he was also released after three months on grounds of good conduct. In that case, too, a high-profile and respected institution was involved.\nIn February, an Indiana student had to spend only a day behind bars for conducting a violent rape just because he pled guilty.\nThe hypocritical approaches of American criminal justice system have upset Lostutter a lot. He stated that “You get 16 years for forcibly entering your way into a computer, but you get 1 year for forcibly entering your way into a woman. I think that’s the precedent the government is setting here.”\nMust Read: Anonymous Doxes and Forces Pro-Rape Pick-up Artist To Cancel His Meetings\nThis is not the first time when Anonymous exposed faces behind rape.

While militaries of both countries are fighting for a piece of land, their hackers are targeting each other on the Internet.\nThe latest cyber attack comes from Azerbaijani hackers going by the handle of Anti-Armenia Team who claim to have hacked Armenian government servers including the Armenian national security ministry and leaked a trove of confidential data including passport copies of locals and foreign citizens who visited Armenia.\nThe National Security Service of the Republic of Armenia is a republican body of executive authority, which elaborates and implements the policies of the Republic of Armenia Government in the national security sector and manages national security bodies.\n\nHackRead can confirm that there are several other scanned passport copies of citizens from India, China, Georgia, Iran, United Kingdom and the United States.\nHackers also claim to have stolen ministry data that includes “slanderous and calumnious information about the US diplomats in other countries.”\nIn an exclusive conversation with one of the hackers from Anti-Armenia Team, HackRead was told that,\n“We at Anti-Armenia Team are are announcing that we hacked the heart of Armenia and leaked personal and confidential data of its government, citizens and even those who visited the country as everything is allowed in love and war, we are in a war with Armenia and will remain at war until they stop.”\nThis is not the first time when Anti-Armenia Team has come up with such confidential data stolen from Armenian security service. In their previous hacks, the team leaked several secret documents which they claimed were stolen from National Security Service of Armenia.\nStatement from Armenian hackers:\nOn the other hand, Armenian hackers from Monte Melkonian Cyber Army are claiming that the aforementioned hack is phony. One of the hackers from MMCA told HackRead that,\n“Azeris hacker group anti Armenia says hacked our NSS database, leaked documents and share pictures from NSS DB system and docs, but this is a fake news . They are only share 2013 picture from Armenia visa system and say again we hacked Armenia NSS”\n\nThe Register has also covered the hack; according to them, the leaked data is legit however it looks more like an inside job rather than a hack by Azerbaijani hackers.\nRemember, there are no diplomatic relations between the two countries and they are still technically at war because of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and dispute.\nAt the time of publishing this article; the leaked data was publically available for anyone to download.\nAnonymous Hacks Deutsche Bank Group’ Subsidiary Against Aachen Repression\nThe online hacktivist Anonymous alongside with an Anarchist group hacked and defaced the official website of Deutsche Immobilien-Leasing Ltd (Dil.de | German Real Estate Leasing) and leaked a trove of data from its server. The targeted estate leasing site is a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank Group, a German global banking and financial services company based in Frankfurt.\nAnonymous targeted the site under the banner of OpAnarchists, an online operation started against the arrest of an Anarchist Lisa Askatu in 2015. In an exclusive conversation with one of the hacktivists behind this attack, HackRead was told that the reason for targeting Deutsche Bank Group was to register their protest against her alleged unlawful arrest.\nGerman Immobilien-Leasing GmbH:\nThe German Immobilien-Leasing GmbH works as an organ subsidiary of German Bank AG manages a portfolio of real estate leasing commitments with commercial and municipal customers, more than 150 investment companies with more than 100,000 investors who have invested in closed-end funds with different asset classes and provides a comprehensive investor service.\nStory of her arrest:\nIn July 2015, Lisa Askatu, a pro-Anonymous anarchist was arrested at a passport control at the Greek-Bulgarian border. The Europe-wide arrest warrant against her had been issued by the prosecution office of Aachen, Germany, on the 24th of June 2015. In Germany, she got locked up under the ‘U-haft‘ (Untersuchungshaft) administration Cologne because of her alleged involvement in an armed bank robbery that had taken place two years earlier (2013).\n\nOn the 2nd December 2015, after months of investigation, the prosecution formally charged her with bank robbery, hostage taking and weapon possession. On the 16th of December, the court called the prison instructing them to release the because all charges were to be dropped, since the “evidence” that months of investigation produced was not sufficient for this case to be brought to court.” However, on Wednesday the 13th of April the same prosecutor’s office ordered a series of house raids in Barcelona that resulted in the arrest of another comrade; she is said to have participated in a bank robbery that was carried out in Aachen in 2014.\nSince then Anonymous and other activists have been protesting against her arrest however this is the first time when a major financial company was targeted as a protest.\nWhat data was leaked?\nAnonymous shared a Pastie file (works only on Tor browser) with HackRead that shows data stolen from Dil.de’s server. Upon scanning the data we have found it to be legit and never been leaked online before. The leaked data includes email addresses of more than 900 registered users, telephone numbers, mobile numbers, fax numbers, full names, company names, zip codes and street addresses.\nThe data also includes admin emails and their hashed passwords, email conversations showing discussion about company’s portfolio, customers and letter to appreciation for Stewart, Fletcher & Barrett (SFB Group), a business and chartered accountant firm based in the United Kingdom.\n\nAnonymous’s exclusive talks with HackRead:\nThe group behind this attack gave a brief and exclusive comment explaining the hack as following:\n”We dropped a banner (deface) in solidarity with the anarchic comrades, imprisoned by the Spanish\/Dutch state in collaboration with the German state in order to protect the private property of banks; a facade, as everyone knows, of arms trade and international funding of present and future wars. Solidarity is a weapon, and we’ll continue to use it”\nAnonymous also revealed that it’s not just one person, there are three arrested comrades and Lisa is one of them. The group vowed to target Deutsche and other German banks in next few days. Let’s see how it goes.\nAt the time of publishing this article; the German Immobilien-Leasing site was restored.\nOpIran – Anonymous Hits Iranian State Sites, Hacks Over 300 CCTV Cameras\nIn the wake of the recent Iranian government crackdown on dissent after Mahsa Amini’s death, the international hacktivist group Anonymous has launched a new operation against the country’s online infrastructure.\nDubbed OpIran (Operation Iran) by Anonymous; the hacktivists have taken down a number of top government websites and hacked over 300 security cameras in different parts of the country.\nIt is worth noting that on September 16th, 2022, a 22-year-old Iranian woman named Mahsa Amini died in Tehran, Iran, under Police custody. Amini was arrested for failure to follow government-mandated forms of the Hijab.\nOn the other hand, authorities claim Amini died of natural causes after suffering heart failure at the police station. However, Iranians have rejected the official explanation and have taken their protests (Mahsa Amini protests (aka September 2022 Iranian protests) to the streets.\nOn Twitter, YourAnonNews, one of the largest social media representatives of the Anonymous movement, and several other popular Anonymous handles have confirmed their support for Iranian protesters. Thus the recent cyber attacks were carried out under the banner of OpIran.\nAccording to Anonymous, the modus operandi of OpIran involves DDoS attacks (Distributed Denial of Service attacks), data breaches, social engineering attacks, quick tutorials on how to beat state censorship by using the Tor browser, and evading arrests by police.\nThe first major Iranian government institution to suffer a cyberattack from Anonymous hackers is its Forensic Research Center. As seen by Hackread.com, Anonymous managed to successfully deface its domains and leak a database containing 100MB worth of data.\nAccording to Hackread.com’s analysis, the data contains names, email addresses, logs including IP addresses of the Center’s site visitors worldwide.\nAlthough Anonymous is famous for its large-scale DDoS attacks and data breaches (the group proved its point during OpRussia during Ukraine and Russia conflict), lately, they have been going a step further by hitting the vulnerable IoT infrastructure in the targeted country.\nIn the case of Russia, as reported by Hackread.com, Anonymous managed to hack over 400 security cameras across the country while sending almost 10 million texts to Russian citizens to raise awareness about the conflict.\nIn the latest, Anonymous has claimed to have compromised 300 security camera installations by exploiting a 5.4 severity score vulnerability.\nThis however is not the first time when hackers have hacked into CCTV cameras in Iran. In August last year, hackers from Edaalate Ali (Ali’s Justice or Ali’s Court) group breached the computer system and security cameras at a prison facility in northern Tehran and leaked live footage of grim conditions and grave human rights violations taking place in the prison.\nSince launching OpIran, Anonymous has carried out a series of DDoS attacks against Iranian state institutions. Some of these include the following:\nNational Government Portal of Iran (Iran.gov.ir)\nThe official website of the Central Bank of Iran (Cbi.ir)\nThe official website of the Government Spokesman Office (Dolat.ir)\nThe official website of Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran (Khamenei.ir)\nThe official website of the Iranian State media agency IRIB News Agency (Iribnews.ir)\nAt the time of writing, all the above-mentioned domains were offline.\nJUST IN: In response to a violent police crackdown of protestors and censoring communications, #Anonymous launched #OpIran and have now hacked over 100 Iranian websites, including several belonging to the Iranian government. #IranProtests #مهساامینی pic.twitter.com\/3TmcK9jqdb\nFor now, it remains to be seen how effective Anonymous’ latest operation will be. However, it is clear that the group is determined to continue its fight against what it sees as an oppressive regime.\nRussian Olympics whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova hacked after Wada Breach\nOn 12th August a Twitter handle claiming affiliation with Anonymous Poland branch of the hacktivist group hacked the official website of WADA-CAS (World Anti-Doping Agency and Court of Arbitration for Sport’s servers) and leaked thousands of login credentials on a file sharing website.\n\nNow, reports are that Yuliya Stepanova, a Russian athlete who assisted the agency in exposing the doping scandal before Rio Olympics has been hacked due to the data leaked from Wada’s servers.

This is debatable but recently an Israeli security firm, Intsights, claimed to have hacked into a Dark Web forum hosted through Telegram and operated by ISIS to plan future terrorist attacks.\n\nRelated: Anonymous Deface ISIS Twitter Accounts with Pornographic Content\nThe firm claims that hacking into the forum allowed them to expose plannings regarding future terrorist attacks and discussions regarding previous attacks including the killing of an 85-year-old Catholic priest in a French Church.

The leak also exposes the administrator account including the username, password (MD5), email address and name. Based on Hacked-DB analysis the user details are indeed valid and are linked to the Parsiva.daba.co.ir website.\n\n\nThe hacker was identified as pro-Israel and the tweet information indicated that there are 52K users in the leak, however, only three parts of the actual data were posted online as can be seen based on the pastie titles.\nDaba, the hacked company also provides dial-up, voice services, ADSL communication, Internet cards and other services to users in Iran and hacking of such ISPs is always a blow to the innocent users however Iranians are not new to such privacy breaches. Just last month; an Internet bot exposed personal details of thousands of Telegram users in Iran, the data contained full names, phone numbers and personal address of registered Telegram users.\nThere’s hardly ever someone from Israel combating the large-scale cyber attacks from pro-Palestinian hackers. In 2012, an Israeli hacking group calling itself IDF hacking team shut down stock exchange websites in Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a revenge for hacking attack carried out by Nightmare hackers which took down Israeli airline El Al’s, Tel Aviv stock exchange website and The First International Bank of Israel (FIBI)’s website.\nAnonymous Hacks Sarah Silverman’ Twitter For “Bernie or Bust” Comment\nThe online hacktivist Anonymous hacked the official Twitter account of Sarah Silverman, a famous American actress, stand-up comedian, producer and writer on 27th July in retaliation for her comment in which she called “Bernie or Bust” supporters ridiculous during Democratic National Convention on Monday.\nSilverman stated that “To the ‘Bernie or Bust’ people, you’re being ridiculous,” and in reply on Wednesday; a hacker claiming to be Anonymous took over her verified Twitter handle and Tweeted in English and Russian-language “America, are you awakening?” #Hilary4Prison and #Anonymous. The hacker also posted a video message stating anti-Hillary Clinton comments including calling her ”Root of all Corruption.”\n\nMust Read: Anonymous Urge Hackers To Join Them in Cyber Attacks Against Donald Trump\n\nHere is a screenshot shared by a Twitter user Jimmy McGiggin:\n\nMeanwhile, Sarah Silverman also acknowledged that she was being hacked and denied having any connection with the anti-Hillary tweet that came from her account.\n\nMY TWITTER ACCT GOT HACKED THIS IS NOT ME  https:\/\/t.co\/hmZYLdrjxi\n— Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) July 27, 2016\n\nSarah Silverman has been a powerful pro-Bernie voice throughout the election campaign but some found her comments staggering.

The motive behind the attack was to protest against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and vowing to help the citizens.\nThe attack on Izmir Gaz website allowed attackers to steal financial and personal records stored on the server including plain-text and hashed passwords for 479 users which were leaked online. As cited by SoftPedia, leaked files also contained maintenance reports, budgeting and billing files stolen from the server.\n\nAccording to official blog post from Anonymous, the reason for targeting Izmir Gaz website: ”We hacked www.izmirgaz.comtr for two reasons: Company owners have good relations with Erdo and İzmir is city what Prime Minister Binali Yildirim elected.”\n\nIn a brief statement, Anonymous accused Erdoğan of censoring social media in the country and urged citizens to go through AKP emails leaked by WikiLeaks recently. Hacktivists are also planning on translating the 300,000 leaked email and 500 thousand documents to raise awareness about the situation in Turkey.\nTurkish government and citizens are not new to such cyber attacks, in fact, the country has faced large-scale attacks including DDoS attacks on local banks, hacking of its national police server and recent leak in which entire Turkish citizenship database was stolen and posted online.\nAt the time of publishing this article, the Izmir Gaz website was down revealing that the attack was powerful enough to keep the site down for days.\nAnonymous DDoS Rio Court Website for Blocking WhatsApp in Brazil\nThe online hacktivist Anonymous Brazil said on Tuesday (19th) that in a collective cyber attack the group has shut down the official website of the Court of Rio de Janeiro in response to its decision to block the messaging app service WhatsApp in Brazil.\nAnonymous Brazil confirmed the attacks on their Facebook page stating that the site remained offline until 14:40 Brazil time.\n\nThe action of hackers occurred after the Court of Rio ruled to block WhatsApp because the application does not share information about criminal investigations. The decision was made by judge Daniela Barbosa de South of the 2nd Criminal Court of Duque de Caxias County, according to Folha.\n“The court order was not met, despite repeated three times, thus the adoption of coercive measures determined by this judgment,” says Souza in the decision that activated the immediate block on WhatsApp.\nWhatsApp, on the other hand, does not share users’ conversation with law enforcement agencies in Brazil and argues that it no longer stores users’ conversations. In April 2016, it implemented “end-to-end”encryption (in which only people in the conversation can read messages). With that said, it is impossible to disclose the data.\nHISTORY\nThis is not the first attempt by authorities blocked WhatsApp in the country. In February, a judge in Teresina (PI) ordered to ban the messaging service. The reason behind the ban was WhatsApp’s refusal to provide information to the police about an investigation.\nIn May this year, a decision of the Court of Sergipe determined that WhatsApp will stay off the air for 72 hours. The process culminated in the decision by the judge Marcel Montalban, in March, to arrest Diego Dzodan, vice president of Facebook in Brazil, the company that owns the app, for Latin America. The judge wanted the company to transfer information on an interstate drug gang for an investigation by the Federal Police, which the company refuses to do.\nTelecom companies like Tim Hi, Vivo, Claro, and Nextel- decided to abide by the court decision. Non-compliance would be subject to a daily fine of R $ 500 thousand.\nThe president of Anatel, John Rao, WhatsApp blockade was “a disproportionate decision because it punishes all users.” For him, “WhatsApp must comply with the court orders within the technical conditions it has. But of course, blocking is not the solution.”\nWhatsApp works with computers registry and this makes the lock work quite complicated for the telcos, which can be punished if they fail to implement fully the lock.\nIn December last year, WhatsApp had been blocked in Brazil for 48 hours due to a criminal investigation. At the time, the telcos were surprised to have received the court order although the decision did not last 48 hours.\nIn February, a similar case occurred in Piauí, when a judge also ruled a WhatsApp lock in Brazil. The goal was to force the company that owns the application to work with state police investigations related to cases of pedophilia.\nAt the time of publishing this article, the targeted site was back online while WhatsApp service was also restored in the country.\nOpAfrica: Anonymous hacks South African arms procurement agency\nThe operation OpAfrica has found another victim, this time, it’s the Pretoria-based arms procurement agency Armscor or Armaments Corporation of South Africa. The breach which took place just a few hours ago can be labeled as a massive hack as Armscor is the official arms procurement agency of the South African Department of Defence.\nThe hacktivist behind this hack is the same one who previously hacked two Israeli arms importers and leaked client details in public for operation OpIsrael, however, this time the hacker has chosen the dark net to leak 63 MB data in HTML files that include invoices numbers, order numbers, invoice amount etc of Airbus, Thales group, Rolls Royce, Eads or EADS (European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company), Denel etc.\nIn an exclusive conversation with Anonymous hacker, HackRead was told that he has access to 19938 supplier IDs, names and their plaintext passwords. The passwords, in this case, allow anyone to login into Settlement System as supplier or manager. The hacker also disclosed that the agency’s site has several bugs including one that allows anyone to open a settlement by simply using supplier ID without the password.\nWhen asked what security flaw was used to bypass site’s security the hacker said: \n“It was simple SQL injection.”\nUpon an in-depth scan, we found customer and trade data including customer IDs, company and trading Address, customer name, order Numbers, invoice numbers, invoice amount, invoice balance, invoice dates, transaction dates and received cheque numbers from 2014 to 2016. \nThere are about 104 HTML files, however, we can confirm that no emails or passwords have been leaked but transaction details for high profile defence and aeronautical companies are out for public access.\nIn the past, the same Anonymous hacktivist hacked UN Climate Change’ Webcast Streaming Service Provider, UN Climate Change website and South African Government Contractor for operation OpMonsanto.\nAnonymous DDoS Zimbabwe Government Sites for #ShutDownZimbabwe\nThe online hacktivists Anonymous conducted a series of cyber attacks on the Zimbabwe government websites last Monday for #ZimShutDown2016 or #ShutDownZimbabwe, a protest movement in which citizens are protesting against the Robert Mugabe’s government who has been in power for last 36 years. \nAnonymous has also been conducting Operation OpAfrica since 2015 which aims to attack government and oil sectors against corruption, child abuse and child labor in the continent. The recent attack on Zimbabwean government website disrupted the online service of the country’s official portal (zim.gov.zw), ZANUPF – Zimbabwe African National Union- Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) and Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (zbc.co.zw).\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/zim4thewin\/status\/750661944009515008\nIt was just last month when the same hacktivists announced their next target will be Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation and on 6th July the website went down for hours in support of the protestors and censorship.\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/zim4thewin\/status\/750687192511569920\nAccording to eNews Channel Africa, Zimbabwean authorities did attempt to block social media platforms amid protest but despite that the #ZimShutDown2016 was trending all over social media.\nThis is not the first time Anonymous Africa has conducted DDoS attacks against high-profile targets in Zimbabwe. In September 2015, Anonymous shut down a state-run newspaper Zimbabwe Herald for allegedly promoting racism in the country. \nAt the time of publishing this article, all targeted websites were restored however Anonymous Africa has vowed another attack in the coming days.\nUpdate:\nAbout 21hous ago Anonymous conducted another attack on Zimbabwe African National Union- Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) forcing the website to go offline again.\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/zim4thewin\/status\/751433159514976256\nAnonymous Africa also Tweeted about their involvement in OpAfrica stating that the group is not fully involved in the operation: \nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/zim4thewin\/status\/751093055428628481\nHackers Just Leaked Personal Data of US Military Officials and it’s Legit\nGhost Squad Hackers (GSH) made their entry a few months ago by conducting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and Black Lives Matter websites. The group then took part in Anonymous‘ linked operation OpIcarus against banking and financial institutions but the latest attack shows the hackers have graduated to a whole new level.\nYes, Ghost Squad Hackers have published US Military email accounts and personal information as part of #OpSilence campaign, the data was first uploaded to an onion site in the DarkNet and later published on other media like social networks and Pastebin.\nThe data was first found and analysed by Shay Rozen, cyber intelligence and Darknet expert for Hacked-DB who found out that there is a raw .txt file containing 4948 Lines of data on 2,437 US Army personals including names, emails, phone numbers, Dob, addresses, zip codes, credit card data including types, numbers, expiration date and CVV codes in plain text.\nIn the original onion site that published the data first the hackers said:\n“Fear is freedom! Subjugation is liberation! The contradiction is the truth! These are the truths of this world! Surrender to those truths, you pigs who fawn over clothing!” ~~Ghost Squad Hackers~~ #OpSilence!\nGreetings United States government —We are Ghost Squad Hackers–,– Since 911 the recent uprisings of conflict in the middle east you have perpetuated a false allegory of terrorism from multiple instituted false flag events and attacks on your very own people, with almost forcing other countries to take you as a legitimate threat being you have a total over 900 bases outside your borders. It’s time to start asking if you are really for democracy or for expanding your empire. We are seeing more and more of your troops landing in other countries, we are releasing Military officials of your government from credit card information, to names and phone numbers and emails. A total of over 5000 United states military personnel will fall victim to this attack, we are not afraid of your empire, your new home will fall. Expect chaos”\n\nA Little more information about #OpSilence:\n\nAs of June 1st, Ghost Squad Hackers – one of the groups participating in #OpIcarus launched a series of coordinated attacks against leading members of the corporate ‘mainstream’ media. The group selected its next target for this month’s series of cyber-attacks in their latest campaign named OpSilence. Mainstream media outlets will be the next sufferers with the group already successfully launching multiple attacks on the email servers of CNN and FOX News.\nHackRead is in touch with the hackers and will update the article with more detailed information. Stay tuned!\nAnonymous Hacktivists Leak 1TB of Top Russian Law Firm Data\nRustam Kurmaev and Partners work with the Russian government and other high-profile banking, media, oil, and industrial companies, including American firms.\nThe Anonymous hacktivists collective has struck Russia again by leaking approximately 1TB of data from a leading Russian law firm identified as Rustam Kurmaev and Partners (RKP Law).\nThe news arrives just two days after the collective leaked hundreds of gigabytes of data from the servers of Russia’s largest media holdings with over 100 regional radio stations, Vyberi Radio.\nIt is worth noting that Anonymous waged a cyberwar against Russia in late February 2022 dubbed #OpRussia after the country invaded Ukrainian territories, referring it to “special military operation” to denazify and demilitarize Ukraine.\nThe hacktivists who go by the Twitter handle of @DepaixPorteur and @B00daMooda took to Twitter to announce the leaking of the data trove belonging to RKP Law. In one tweet, @DepaixPorteur stated that:\nWe are Anonymous – We have hacked RKPLaw (rkplawru) and leaked 1TB of files, emails, court files, client files, backups, and more! They have a very large (220 clients) and an interesting client list which I will post in the comments.\nEmma Best, a journalist, and co-founder of a non-profit whistleblower organization Distributed Denial of Secrets, aka DDoSecrets, also tweeted about the leak. Best announced that the enormous data dump is also available on DDoSecrets.\nOn the other hand, @YourAnonNews, and @YourAnonTV, two of the largest social media representatives of the Anonymous movement also tweeted about the data leak stating that:\n“Once again, #Anonymous delivers Many thanks to @DepaixPorteur,” tweeted @YourAnonNews. “Just In: #Anonymous released a terabyte of data and emails from Rustam Kurmaev and Partners (RKP Law), a Russian law firm that works with major banking, media, oil, and industrial firms and state interests, including American companies. #OpRussia,” said @YourAnonTV.\nRustam Kurmaev and Partners has been operating in Russia for over 20 years and represents around 500 clients, including the Volkswagen Group Russia, Ikea, Toyota, Jones Lang LaSalle, Mechel PJSC, ChTPZ PJSC, Abbott Laboratories, Baker Hughes, ING Bank, Yamaha Motor, Caterpillar, Panasonic, Mars, Gilette, 2×2 Channel, VimpelCom, Citibank, and Sberbank.\nAccording to DDoSecrets, revealed that RKP Law was hacked by Anonymous affiliated B00da (@B00daMooda) and Porteur (@DepaixPorteur). The leak could be devastating for the company considering that it specializes in resolving real estate, construction, corporate, and commercial sector disputes.\nMoreover, the law firm also resolves disputes regarding the criminal defense of business and creates a systematic defense strategy for corporate managers and top management in various stages of criminal proceedings. Furthermore, the company deals in anti-corruption law as well.\nAnonymous Boosts Up OpIcarus, Shuts Down Bilderberg Group Website\nIt seems like the online hacktivist Anonymous has moved its focus from banks to even bigger fishes as this time the group has conducted a powerful cyber attack on the official website of Bilderberg Group, Bilderberg conference, Bilderberg meetings or Bilderberg Club, a controversial annual private conference of 120 to 150 people (also referred as political elite) of the European and North American political elite, experts from industry, finance, academia, and the media.\nThe cyber attack would have been a usual act of hacktivism but what makes it special is that the conference is starting from today till the 12th of this month (9th June to 12th June) in Germany and targeting the conference website when it’s about to begin shows Anonymous is sending a clear message to the elite. The attendees of this conference include former heads of the CIA  and MI6, bankers, prime ministers and heads of states.\nRemember, since the launch of OpIcarus, Anonymous took down several banking sites including France, UAE, Philippines, Tunisia, Trinidad And Tobago (Read more link 1), Jordan, South Korea, Monaco and Montenegro (Read more Link 2), Kenya, Panama, Bosnia And Herzegovina (Read more Link 3), Guernsey, Netherlands and Maldives (Read more link 4), Central bank in Cyprus and Greece (Read more Link 5).\n\nHowever, on June 8th, the Bilderberg Group faced distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) forcing the servers to remain offline for about four hours. A screenshot shared by Anonymous hacktivists on their Facebook page shows the moment when the group’s site went offline:\n\n\n@Op_Icarus Bilderberg is an internal error. #TangoDown #OpIcarus #OpIcarusPhase3 #ProjectMayhem #OpMayhem pic.twitter.com\/Zn9ah5PWgG\n— D4RKD474 (@The_Voice6667) June 9, 2016\n\nRead also: Anonymous leads the way again as world’s most prolific hacktivist group\n\nIn an exclusive conversation with hacktivists behind the attack, HackRead was told that:\n“The elite will pay for their crimes.

The time to either be part of that system or reject that system is now. No more are we prepared to watch our “elite” run this planet into the ground at the expense of everybody else’s life.

A message was posted as a Tweet from this group informing about the leak that has been carried out as a protest against the gag law.\nWe warned,they didn't listen: https:\/\/t.co\/ztftDSR8q8https:\/\/t.co\/mXtOvPGUs3FULL DMP: https:\/\/t.co\/GuhefTDDw9#Deface #Dump #Leak #AnonOps\n— F**kPoliceAnonOps (@FkPoliceAnonOps) May 31, 2016\n\nIn 2015, HackRead reported how Spain offers a unique gagging law that has been used in strange ways where people can be fined for posting images of security agencies on social media referring to a woman who was fined 800 euros\/$889 USD for posting a picture of the car parked in the disabled spot.\nIt looks like the hackers gained access to the telecom unit for investigative crimes of the police department and obtained the data ending up dumping it online.\nThe statement posted by the group using the Twitter handle mentioned above is as follows:\n“We are publishing a list of members of your ‘force’ in order to make you understand how thin is the curtain (or the balaclava) behind which you are hiding. Make no mistake, with every action, comes a counter reaction and we all have to pay for our acts!”\n“Approximately 5400 police members’ identities will be revealed and dumped into the FREE public domain, together with your ID numbers, emails and password hash. The target was mupol.es, a mutual fund for Spanish policemen.”\nAt the time of publishing this article, the dumped data was removed from almost all the sites, however, a cache version is still available for public view.\nAnonymous Linked Team Hacks Kenyan Oil Firm Against Police Brutality\nAnonymous doesn’t cease to make headlines this year. Only yesterday we learnt that it has topped the list of most active hacker group in the first half of 2016 and today we are reporting that World Hacker Team (WHT) has strike again.\nPerhaps, the #OpAfrica campaign has entered its second stage because Anonymous pledged that very soon the second phase will be instigated in which high-profile firms and organizations will be attacked.\nWHT is a small-scale subdivision of Anonymous. In the recent attack, WHT has managed to hijack the databases of National Oil Corporation of Kenya (nationaloil.co.ke) and also posted the data online as well as posted a screenshot to prove the legitimacy of their claim.\nThe group shared a link with users that contained site link where the said data was available. It has been revealed that this particular data dump is nothing to worry about much because it is related to a survey management CMS. Apparently, the group found this data on the official website of National Oil Corporation.\nThere are basically two tables in this database dump one of which contains employee details of the company, who are those employees who could access the CMS. This table includes email addresses, usernames and email content of the employees along with their use ranks. The data include five admins. The other table also contains similar information but the number of users is higher, 218 to be precise and all appear to be employees of the Kenyan oil firm, as cited by Catalin Cimpanu of SoftPedia.\nIn an exclusive conversation with one of the attackers HackRead was told that:\n“Lately, there have been several cases of police brutality in the country and Anonymous wants the Kenyans to know we are with them!”\nThe leaked data can be accessed using Tor Onion browser. This is not the first time when Anonymous has targeted Kenya’s oil and gas infrastructure. In March 2016, Kenya Petroleum Refineries LTD website was defaced for OpAfrica. That’s not all, Anonymous also leaked highly confidential communication and protocol data belonging to the Kenya’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nWe can expect an increment in similar data breaches in African regions despite the fact that this particular breach hasn’t been a devastating one. Probably Anonymous wants us to know that the operation hasn’t stopped yet.\nHacktivists Shut Down Donald Trump Hotel Collections Website\nRemember the ruthless DDoS attackers from Ghost Squad who previously shut down websites of several banks, Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement? They are back with yet another attack and this time the target is none other than American presidential Candidate and billionaire Donald Trump.\nYes, the Ghost Squad hackers just conducted a powerful Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) on the Trump Hotel Collection website forcing it to go offline and display the Cloud Flare’s version for the home page. Those visiting the website can see a message confirming that the site is offline:\nThis page (trumphotelcollection.com) is currently offline. However, because the site uses CloudFlare’s Always Online™ technology you can continue to surf a snapshot of the site. We will keep checking in the background and, as soon as the site comes back, you will automatically be served the live version.\nBannedOffline, one of the attackers from Ghost Squad tagged HackRead in his recent tweet about the attack. He also announced to that the groups reason was to target Trump’s hate mongering and the use of Cloud Flare protection which has been pointed out for protecting websites spreading hate and terrorism.\nIn an exclusive conversation with the attackers, HackRead was told that:\n“We Chose To DDoS His Hotel Collection Website Because Of A Statement He Said In His Speech “I will build a great, great wall, on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall.” Also, on TV today, he apologized acting like he did not mean anything he said about Muslims or Mexicans. Words do not go away when you say something mean you obviously mean it then regret it sooner or later. Also, we have noticed CloudFlare has their mind on protecting websites that contain explicit material such as animal p*rn and isis supporting sites. This Is Only The Beginning Though As We Have Future Plans For Hillary Clinton And His Main Website.”\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/BannedOffline\/status\/733745965367234560\nThis is not the first time when Donald Trump has his websites under cyber attacks. In fact, the Anonymous hacktivists have been targeting his sites since his hate speech against Muslims and Mexicans. In January 2016, Anonymous had shut down Trump’s Election Campaign website however, DDoS is not the only thing hurting Trump’s business, there have been several data breaches and stealing of customers’ credit card data from his hotels’ computer servers.\nAt the time of publishing this article, the Trump Hotel Collection website was down and displaying Cloud Flare’s message on the home page.\nHacker Steals and Donates €10K in Bitcoin to Kurdish Group\nDo you remember Algerian hacker Hamza Bendelladj who was arrested in Malaysia for hacking into banks and donating a large amount of money to Palestinian charities? Well, he’s in prison now but there’s another good hacker who has been hacking and donating money to anti-ISIS forces.\nThis hacker is quite intelligent and well-versed at the technique, which is why it is such an easy job for this hacker to conduct such high-profile breaches like that of the Hacking Team and Gamma Group. In the latest strike, this hacker who uses the nickname “Phineas Phisher” “Hack Back!” and “@GammaGroupPR,” has raked in around €10,000 (about £8,000) Bitcoin in a hack attack.\nThe bitcoin amount has been sent to Kurdish anticapitalist group Rojava Plan that is based in Rojava. Rojava is an autonomous region located in northern parts of Syria. This particular anticapitalist group is being regarded as “one of the most inspiring revolutionary projects in the world today.”\n\nThe hacker hasn’t named any of the victims of this hack attack because he is waiting for the right time as “there’s hopefully a few orders of magnitude more on the way.” However, you must be given this information that the US State Department has named this Kurdish group as a “terrorist organization,” that aims to create an independent Kurdish homeland.\nThe region currently is struggling for its survival though due to its conflict with the ISIS or Daesh as well as Turkey, which is hostile towards it, and thus, in desperate need of money at the moment. The group’s crowdfunding page shows this message from Rojava Plan’s Deniz Tarî:\n“We are currently extremely busy and it is sometimes hard to get online, this being a war zone and all. You can see the payments made to our campaign on the campaign page. You can also check our Bitcoin address, which is public.”\nOver €26,000 has already been donated to the group, as per its crowdfunding page, and there are plans of purchasing some products including two trucks, a hangar, and a small bulldozer.\nThe hacker stated that the reason behind donating such a huge sum of money in bitcoin was because they are in an “incredibly difficult situation.” The hacker further stated that “with ISIS on one side and US ally Turkey embargoing and attacking them on the other. Yet, in a part of the world, the West likes to look down on as a backward shithole, they’re building a society that takes ‘Western’ values like democracy and feminism to lengths that put the West to shame. All while fighting ISIS and winning, unlike the US-trained and supplied Iraqi army.”\nSo, the hacker claims that the money was donated not to support the cause of Rojava but also to bring the media’s attention to this region.\nDid Anonymous Hack Turkish Hospitals Resulting in Massive Data Breach?\nA hacker claiming links with Anonymous hacktivist group has uploaded a Youtube video claiming to have hacked into the servers of Turkish medical institutions and leaked massive database from the systems. In the video, a figure wearing the standard Anonymous Guy Fawkes mask is heard saying that this cyber attack is an act of “revenge” against the hacking of two hospitals in the United States.\nBut, there is a twist to the story because the response from several Anonymous Twitter accounts is negative as they have completely denied any involvement with the recent cyber attack leading to the data leak as it affects the privacy of Turkish citizens. However, the damage has been done and the database is publically available on the Internet.\nNor we as @YourAnonNews nor @crymora nor anyone we know and trust has anything to do with this. This leak is bullshit. @heavie\n— Anonymous (@YourAnonNews) May 18, 2016\n\nWhat’s going on?\nA YouTube video message uploaded on May 17, 2016, claims to steal personal details of Turkish citizens from the databases of medical institutions in Turkey while destroying the original database stolen from North West Turkey. Upon scanning the leaked data HackRead found it to be legit and has never been leaked on the Internet before.\nThe leaked data is quite sensitive and can put patients lives in danger as it includes complete details of people who are HIV and women who have had an abortion.\n\nEarlier a Turkish hacker had claimed responsibility of targeting computer systems of two hospitals in the United States with ransomware; however, researcher expressed their doubts over the claims. \n\nResponse from Turkish government: \nAs one can expect, the government always try to calm things down and same has happened in this case when the official spokesperson from the Ministry of Health confirmed the attack but denied large-scale damage. In a statement issued to the Hurriyet Daily News newspaper  the official claimed fairly minimal damage. However, things are far from the truth! The attack is large-scale and its impact will be long lasting.\nThis is not the first time when Turkish citizens have seen their privacy getting breached. In fact, just last month an unknown hacker leaked entire Turkish citizen database online, that’s about 49,611,709 people. In another attack, hackers hacked Turkish National Police and leaked personal details plus police records amounting to17 GB of data. You can read more about cyber attacks on Turkey by clicking here.\nThis cyber attack leaves a black spot on Anonymous community and shows how vulnerable their infrastructure is as they have no official spokesperson. Anonymous on one hand is known for their heroic cyber attacks but attacks like this leave several questions on the group’s legacy. \nUpdate:\nYoutube has deleted the video posted by hackers.

The reason behind attacking the websites is the Bathroom Law.\nFor your information, this particular law is already garnering criticism from all segments of society. It basically requires people to use public bathrooms as per the gender of their birth. The law is being termed as anti-LGBT. The government has been thrashed badly and popular figures have also issued statements boycotting this law.\n#OpGayRights\nEvery where homosexuality is seen as a crime will get targeted!! Gays have the right to be with who they wanna be with!\n— #OpLGBT (@OperationLGBT) May 15, 2016\n\nThe information about the cyber hack was revealed via the Twitter account @OperationLGBT which was followed by this tweet.\n“F— you North Carolina main govt website… making strong anti-gay laws!”\nAnonymous also mocked North Carolina’s Governor Pat McCory with this tweet:\n“We ask you to reverse the bathroom law or expect more…”\nMust Read: xHamster trolls North Carolina by banning itself against anti-LBGT law\nFuck you North Carolina main govt website https:\/\/t.co\/FCWiXrOTVo #TangoDown\nFor making strong anti-gay laws! pic.twitter.com\/b5tve8z9vb\n— #OpLGBT (@OperationLGBT) May 14, 2016\n\nThe websites that have been attacked include several critically important domain names such as the following:\n • ncgov.org,\n • ncgov.net,\n • ncgov.com,\n • np.nc.gov,\n • governor.state.nc.us,\n • northcarolina.gov\nThe state websites bearing any of these domain names weren’t accessible this Monday whereas the main website of the state was fully operational. According to an official spokesperson for the state, all of the “state government websites” were “operating as normal.” However, what gets highlighted and even strengthened by this act of Anonymous is the fact that no matter how notorious this group appears to be, it has consistently taken a stand against governments, institutions, and officials over matters of common man’s interest. \nIt has become the voice of hundreds and thousands of individuals, who haven’t had any particular, solid platform to voice their opinions, disgust over certain decisions and ill practices of the governments and institutions. From corruption to child sexual abuse, terrorism to laws, Anonymous has remained true to its vision, which is to safeguard public’s civil rights and to informs about the dark and evil deeds of certain individuals.\nThe group has also been busy taking on Donald Trump lately and in December 2015 and January 2016 against anti-Muslim speech. However, when it comes to LGBT rights this is not the first time when Anonymous has DDoSed government websites in the United States. Last year, the hacktivists shut down Indiana State website against anti-LGBT – Religious Freedom law (Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) – In another attack, hacktivists also shut down the website of an Indiana-based Nonprofit organization ‘Right to Life’ for supporting RFRA.\nOpAfrica: Anonymous Deface South African University, Huge Data Leaked\nNew World Hackers (NWH), a group of hackers linked with the online hacktivist Anonymous defaced the official website of Limpopo university in South Africa – The hacktivists also leaked a trove of data stolen from the university’s server.\nThe attack was conducted on 13th May 2016 in which the homepage of the university website was replaced with a page uploaded by hackers with a brief message explaining why the site was targeted. Upon going through the deface message it was revealed that the attack was conducted under the banner of operations OpAfrica, an online op launched last year against corruption, child abuse and child labour in African countries.\nThe main person behind this breach is SinfulHazeCE- however, one of the hackers from NWH contacted HackRead about the breach and informed that some university students even congratulated the group for the successful hack of the university site.\nLeaked data:\n1 A GhostBin post shows one part of the data includes exam and Intranet files uploaded on Maga.nz. \n\n2 Another file shows personal data of 16,000 university alumni publically available on the Internet including names of the students, surnames, ID numbers, their faculty, date of birth, department and campus codes.\n\n3 Last but not the least, one of the files show 1,700 entries including faculty department names, cell numbers, telephone numbers and names.\n\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/wBnJLjlAnj DEFACE AND DATA LEAK\nBY @SinfulHazeCE\nDATA LINK : https:\/\/t.co\/tBJ4EMeIjh#OpAfrica pic.twitter.com\/eMHsQ2PmdX\n— SinfulHazeCE-NWH (@SinfulHazeCE) May 13, 2016\nOpAfrica was launched last year and since then the hacktivists have conducted several successful cyber attacks and data breaches including the defacement of Kenyan Oil Refinery, 1TB of data leak from Kenya’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs, South African Job Portal and 64,000 workers data from Tanzanian Telecom Firm.\nHackRead’s previous coverage on Operation OpAfrica is available here.\nPrevious attacks from NWH:\nNew World Hackers (NWH)’s first cyber attack was on BBC when all of its online services went offline.

We are saying that on the basis of a sudden increase in their cyber attacks on the banking and financial institutions worldwide. Yes, as expected the hacktivists have taken full advantage of Saturday and conducted a series of 250 Gbps DDoS attacks on the bank of France, Central bank of the United Arab Emirates, Central Bank of Tunisia, Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago and Philippine National Bank.\nThe websites of all targeted banks were forced to stay offline for hours but the bank of France was targeted twice in one day while the Philippine National Bank was targeted by Anonymous who told HackRead that the reason for targeting national bank website is to show their support for the hacker arrested by Philippine authorities last month for hacking the official website of the country’s election commission (COMELEC) and leaking entire voters’ database online. \n\n\nIn an exclusive conversation with Anonymous HackRead was told that: \n“The National Bank of the Philippines was attacked to remind the governments that they can arrest hacktivists, but they will never arrest the idea of freedom itself. (#freeanons) For every Anon they incarcerate, 100’s more will appear. The bank of France was taken down to show solidarity and support to the #NuitDebout protesters around the world.We would like to say thanks to Sens power from Russia for shutting down the French bank! We hope to align our online attacks with current protests in the street. This time, the 99% will fight back. Operation Icarus continues.”\nAnonymous has also launched a Facebook event page for anyone seeking more information or screenshots of the cyber attacks conducted for Oplcarus. \nOperation OpIcarus was relaunched in March 2016 however it gained popularity recently. Since the relaunch, Anonymous and Ghost Squad has conducted some massive DDoS attacks on banking and financial institutions worldwide. The previously targeted websites included Central Bank of Jordan, Central bank of South Korea and Bank of Compagnie, Monegasque, Central Bank of Montenegro, the bank of Greece, the central bank of Cyprus, Dutch Central Bank, Central Bank of Guernsey and Maldives Monetary Authority (Central bank and banking regulator), Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nTo read HackRead’s previous coverage on OpIcarus click here.\nAt the time of publishing this article, all targeted websites were restored.\nOpIcarus: Anonymous Shut Down 4 More Banking Websites\nAfter a short break, Anonymous, BannedOffline and Ghost Squad are back in action — Their latest targets to face the fury are banking websites in Jordan, South Korea, Monegasque and Montenegro. All attacks were conducted under the banner of operation OpIcarus.\nThe online hacktivist groups have conducted a series of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and forced the website of Central Bank of Jordan, Central bank of South Korea and Bank of Compagnie, Monegasque to stay offline for about half and hour while the Central Bank of Montenegro was down at the time of publishing this article.\nIn a conversation with HackRead.com one of the attackers explained that:\n“Montenegro is at the heart of elite political corruption. Most of the ISIS\/ISIL terrorist group looted money flows through Jordanian banks and South Korea is pretty much a US army base in the Asia-Pacific. Sites are staying offline for much longer periods now as more people are joining in the Operation. All targets so far have been central banks and no innocent people were harmed. We aim to keep it that way. OpIcarus will continue.”\nHere is a tweet HackRead was tagged in:\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/Op_Icarus\/status\/730887342429339648\nOperation OpIcarus was relaunched in March 2016 however it gained popularity recently.

The hacktivist group posted about this recent development on their Twitter handle, @YourAnonOne. The tweet read:\n“The #Anonymous collective is officially in cyberwar against the pro-Russian hacker group #Killnet.”\nShortly after posting the tweet, Anonymous revealed that the official website of Killnet (Killnet.ru) was taken offline. Anonymous later posted that Killnet’s user database has also been leaked online.\n“Pro Russian hackers group KillNet user database is leaked online by #Anonymous. LOL,” wrote @AnonOpsSE.\nAs seen by Hackread.com, the leaked database contains 146 email address and their plain-text passwords.\nThis act could be in response to the warning issued by cybersecurity agencies in the UK, USA, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, citing that pro-Russian hackers may soon target organizations outside of Ukrainian borders.\nIt is worth noting that the FVEY (Five Eyes Alliance) published a threat assessment report yesterday. The organization revealed that numerous Russian government-sponsored and other hacker groups have vowed to support Russia.\nThe same report claimed that these groups could target Western critical national infrastructure organizations. Some identified cybercrime groups included DDoS attackers Killnet, CoomingProject, Sality botnet fame Salty Spider, and Emotet operators Mummy. Hence, Anonymous wants to disrupt Killnet’s attacking capabilities that have intensified in Europe recently.\nIn an interview with the Russian news network RT, Killnet explained their version of ongoing events. In its interview given in the Russian language, the group claimed that it comprises “ordinary people from all over Russia who stood up to defend their country.”\n“We have always been hated . First, it was the “terrible” empire, then the “bad” Soviet Union, and now it’s the “evil” Russia.” DDoS is the face of our project. Behind the scenes lies a huge amount of work on an invisible front. This is the calculation of the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, hacking enemy systems, monitoring and collecting information, as well as capturing control systems.\nKillnet specializes in DDoS attacks and has recently targeted websites of numerous Italian government ministries and institutions, including the country’s customs agency, foreign affairs department, culture and heritage ministry, education ministry, and the superior council of the judiciary.\nThis hacking spree occurred in early May, while on 16 May, Killnet attacked the Italian upper house of parliament, the Automobile Club d’Italia, and the National Health Institute. In April, Killnet attacked the Romanian government-owned websites, including the Ministry of Defense, with DoS attacks originating from Russia.\nThe pro-Russia group has also attacked the websites of the governments of the USA, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland, and other NATO members.\nOpIcarus Finds More Targets as Banks in Panama, Bosnia and Kenya Go Offline\nIt’s been over a week since Anonymous and Ghost Squad began conducting cyber attacks on banking websites worldwide. It’s the weekend now but the hacktivists aren’t taking a break; while you were sleeping they conducted distributed denial-of-service DDoS attacks on the websites of four International banks including the central bank of Kenya, National Bank of Panama, Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Maldives Monetary Authority.\nThe attack was executed by Ghost Squad Saturday morning forcing the sites to go offline. Though most of the sites are back online, the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina is still offline since yesterday. In an exclusive conversation with attackers HackRead was told that:\n“The National Bank of Panama was a special target considering the importance of Panama Leaks — We want to make sure the corrupt elite named in the papers would be punished one day.”\nHere is a screenshot showing all four banks were down after the attack:\n\nIf you are following HackRead’s exclusive coverage on OpIcarus you would know the operation is against banks and financial institutions around the world. The hacktivists believe banks are controlling the world’s economy, promoting and hiding corruption at governmental and private level.\nSince its relaunch, hacktivists have used OpIcarus to send their message worldwide. The previously targeted banks include the Bank of Greece, Central Bank of Cyprus and Dutch Central Bank.\nStay tuned as we cover upcoming cyber attacks for OpIcarus\nOpIcarus continues as hacktivists shut down 3 more banking websites\nThough they have their difference, when it comes to OpIcarus it seems the Anonymous hacktivists andGhost Squad group have found mutual interests. It all started when Ghost Squad was hailed as heroes after targeting the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) website before doing what could be deemed an about turn when the group targeted Black Lives Matter website. Now that the OpIcarus is gearing up, both Anonymous and Ghost Squad attackers are conducting cyber attacks on banking websites worldwide.\nThe latest to come under distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks is the official website of Dutch Central Bank, Central Bank of Guernsey and Maldives Monetary Authority (Central bank and banking regulator). In an exclusive conversation with the Ghost Squad Attackers, HackRead was told that all three websites remain down for almost a day affecting the online banking service. \nA statement released by the attackers shows they aren’t backing down:\n“This is just the beginning. We won’t stop until all focus is back on the banks where it belongs and all “too big to jail” institutions are held accountable for their crimes. Now that we are uniting our groups, it will only be a matter of time before the whole international banking cartel who are responsible for worldwide economic terrorism, can expect to expect us.”\nHere are some tweets the attackers tagged on our Twitter handle: \nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/Op_Icarus\/status\/728711494700044293\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/Op_Icarus\/status\/728711787902808064\nSince the relaunch of OpIcarus, hacktivists have successfully targeted more than four banking websites including Bank of Greece and Central Bank of Cyprus. The total list of targets is more than 160 banks worldwide. \nThe hacktivists believe the banking system is creating financial problems leading to terrorism, corruption and anarchy. In order to protest against the system, the banking industry must go down according to one of the videos uploaded by the group on YouTube.\n\nAt the time of publishing this article, all targeted websites were restored and available online for the customers.\nOpIcarus: Hacktivists Shut Down Central Bank of Cyprus with DDoS Attack\nA group of hacktivists shut down the official website of Central Bank of Cyprus earlier today for operation OpIcarus, an online operation aimed at targeting banking and financial institutes worldwide. Operation OpIcarus was launched in January 2016 and restarted in March 2016. The hacktivists behind the operation believe banks and financial giants are involved in corruption and to register their protest they had to take the war to a next level.\nThe DDoS attack was conducted earlier this morning when the bank’s website (centralbank.gov.cy) was forced to stay offline. It is unclear for how long the site remained down, however, the attackers shared a screenshot showing the site was down for 35minutes before saving the screenshot.\n\nHackRead had a conversation with one of the attackers behind the attack who said that:\n“The banks have been getting away with murder, fraud, conspiracy, war profiteering, money laundering for terrorists and drug cartels, have put millions of people out on the street without food or shelter and have successfully bought all our governments to help keep us silenced. We represent the voice of the voiceless. We are uniting to make a stand. The central banks which were attacked in recent days were attacked to remind people that the biggest threat we face to an open and free society is the banks. The bankers are the problem and OpIcarus is the solution.”\nThis is the second bank that came under fire since the relaunch of Oplcarus. On 3rd May 2016, the Bank of Greece had its website under series of DDoS attacks and stayed offline for several hours.\nIn the last couple of months, there has been a slight increase in cyber attacks on the banks, first it was the HSBC bank facing DDoS attack on the salary day and then Turkish banks faced cyber attacks disrupting credit card transactions across the country.\nAt the time of publishing this article, the Central Bank of Cyprus website was restored and available online. However, attackers plan to attack the site once again in coming days.\nAnonymous Target Bank of Greece Website with Massive DDoS Attack\nThe online hacktivist Anonymous recently relaunched operation OpIcarus directed towards banking sector in Europe and the United States — The first bank coming under the fire is the Bank of Greece who had their website under a series of distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) forcing the servers to remain offline for more than 6 hours.\nAnonymous’ Operation OpIcarus was launched in January 2016 and restarted in March 2016. The hacktivists behind the operation believe banks and financial giants are involved in corruption and to register their protest they had to take the war to a next level.\nIn an exclusive conversation with one of the hacktivists behind the Greek bank DDoS attack, HackRead was told that:\n“The greek central bank has been offline all day. we would like all banks out there to know that unless they hold themselves accountable for their crimes against humanity that we will strike a new bank every single day and punish them #OpIcarus.”\n\n\nThe hacktivists also released a YouTbe video revealing the reason and a list of banking websites that will be targeted. The list includes banking and financial institutions in Brazil, Bangladesh, China, USA, UK, Pakistan, Iran and several other countries.\nIn the last couple of months, there has been a slight increase in cyber attacks on the banks, first it was the HSBC bank facing DDoS attack on the salary day and then Turkish banks faced cyber attacks disrupting credit card transactions across the country.\nAt the time of publishing this article, the Bank of Greece website was down.\nAnonymous Leaks 1TB of Data from Kenya’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nThe online hacktivist Anonymous has conducted a sophisticated cyber attack on the government of Kenya by breaching its Foreign ministry server, stealing a trove of data and ending up leaking some of it on the Dark Web. The cyber attack was conducted under the banner of operation OpAfrica which was launched last year against child abuse, child labour and corruption in the African countries.\nThe dumped data contains confidential and non-confidential PDF and Docx files from the ministry server including email conversations, security related communication, international trade agreements and letters discussing the security situation in Sudan where government forces are fighting the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA).\nOther letters include conversation related to weapon clearance in Namibia, details about a business collaboration deal between Kenya and Oman, several other documents discussing state officials visiting the country. However, one internal email document is really interesting and talks about security alert for the ministry of foreign affairs’ staff sent by Information Communications Technology (ICT) stating that someone is trying to hack staff email IDs by sending phishing emails containing malicious links. The ICT administrator also shared a screenshot of an email sent by the hackers.\n\nFor readers information the dumped data does not include email addresses or passwords, however, in an exclusive conversation with one of the Anonymous hackers HackRead was told that:\nWe have 1TB of data but at the moment, we have leaked just one portion of it. In few days you will receive full disclosure of the data – We the Anonymous will stand against corruption, child abuse, and child labour! The government of Kenya should have expected.\nThe leaked data can be accessed using Tor Onion browser. Remember, in March 2016, Kenyan oil refinery website was also defaced for OpAfrica. Another group hacked South African job portal, Ugandan Ministry Of Finance and an IT company under the Rwandan government. The group also leaked details of 64,000 workers from Tanzanian telecom firm for OpAfrica.\nStay tuned for full disclosure of the data.\nAnonymous Ghost Squad’s DDoS Attack Shuts Down KKK Website\nThe official website of Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) has been shut down in a series of powerful distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks just a few hours ago. The group behind this attack is Ghost Squad who works with the online hacktivist Anonymous and reason for targeting the KKK is the “blunt racism” in the name of free speech.\nIn an exclusive conversation with one of the attackers, HackRead was told that:\n“We targeted the KKK due to our hackers being up in their face, we believe in free speech but their form of beliefs is monolithic and evil. We stand for constitutional rights but they want anyone who is not Caucasian removed from earth so we targeted the KKK official website to show love for our boots on the ground and to send a message that all forms of corruption will be fought. We are not fascist but we certainly do not agree with the KKK movement. They are the Fascists and they are the Racists.”\nThose visiting the website can see an error message that “The kkkknights.com page isn’t working.”\n\nOne of the attackers also tweeted about the attack:\n#OpKKKhttps:\/\/t.co\/PJmvwxZvYR#Offline#OpStoneMountain Fuck the KKK! pic.twitter.com\/MsDPTGRDyd\n— s1ege (@_s1ege) April 23, 2016\nThis is not the first time when KKK has come under attacks by Anonymous. In the past, the hacktivists leaked personal information of KKK members. The group also conducted DDoS attacks on KKK’s website in October 2015 because one of the Klan members allegedly harassed a woman on Twitter.\nThat’s not all. In 2014, the official website of a Mississippi-based white supremacist organization “The Nationalist Movement” (nationalist.org) was also defaced with messages like “Good night white pride.”\nAt the time of publishing this article, the KKK Knights website was offline worldwide as shown in the screenshot below: \n\n\nAnonymous NB65 Claims Hack on Russian Payment Processor Qiwi\nThe Anonymous affiliated Network Battalion aka NB65 group has allegedly targeted a Russian payment processing platform Qiwi and leaked 7 million payment card data as proof of hack.\nOn May 1st, 2022, NB65, one of the Anonymous affiliate hacktivist groups published a tweet in which it claimed to have gained access to Qiwi’s databases for operation OpRussia. For your information, QIWI plc is a Russian giant that provides payment and financial services in Russia and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries.\nIt is worth noting that NB65 is the same group that had hacked Russian state-run television and radio broadcaster VGTRK aka All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company in April 2022 and leaked 786GB worth of data online.\nAs for the attack on Qiwi, NB65 also tweeted that it managed to extract 10.5TB of data comprising 30 million payment records and filtered 12.5 million credit cards of Qiwi customers. The group also posted a statement revealing that the attack was aimed at disrupting the Russian financial system.\n“Qiwi, in your last press release, you clearly stated that the sanctions against the Russian financial system did not affect your business in any way. Well, it will definitely affect your business.”\nNB65 also stated that they encrypted the platform’s networks with a ransomware kit. Furthermore, the group threatened to release one million records every day after the 3-day contract period expires, and the platform fails to reach out to them.\nAs seen by Hackread.com, on May 5th, 2022, NB65 tweeted two download links and claimed that they contain “7 million card numbers along with the full table of payment records.” Although one of the links was expired, here is what the functional download link contained:\nIn a statement to TASS Russian News Agency, Qiwi denied the claim that NB65 hacked the platform. The company also said that its payment services are functioning normally, and customer data is also safe.\nRussian TV Schedules Hacked on Victory Day to Show Anti-War Messages\nHackers targeted Russian television channels’ program names right before Vladimir Putin’s speech on Victory Day to commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany by the Soviet Union in WWII.\nVictory Day event is celebrated to commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany by the Soviet Union in WWII. However, this time a surprise was in store for Russians watching the Victory Day coverage. Someone hacked various Russian channels’ Victory Day coverage schedule and posted anti-war and pro-Ukrainian messages.  \nAs people were waiting to hear the address of Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday morning, local television channels’ schedule was suddenly altered to display this message:\n “The blood of thousands of Ukrainians and hundreds of murdered children is on your hands. TV and the authorities are lying. No to war.”\nBBC Monitoring’s senior digital journalist Francis Scarr also tweeted about this incident, explaining that the online Russian TV schedule page got hacked. Every program’s name was changed to the same message.\nThe anti-war call appeared when Russians were waiting to watch the annual Victory Day military parade on Red Square, followed by an address by Putin. The hacking affected online viewers of channels transmitted by MTS mobile operators, Rostelecom, NTV Plus, and Wink, while the incident impacted Russians across the country.\nAs per BBC, all major Russian channels, including NTV-Plus, Rossiya, and Channel One, were affected, while The Washington Post claims that the same message appeared on other platforms, including Yandex and Ru Tube. Furthermore, the hack also impacted children’s TV channels and the Russian defense ministry’s station, Zvezda.\nThis morning the online Russian TV schedule page was hackedThe name of every programme was changed to “On your hands is the blood of thousands of Ukrainians and their hundreds of murdered children. TV and the authorities are lying. No to war” pic.twitter.com\/P2uCNz8cqa\nAccording to Reuters, it isn’t currently clear how the messages appeared on the live page. However, this isn’t the first time Russian television channels have been hacked. In March 2022, as reported by Hackread.com, the Anonymous hacktivist collective hacked into Russian state television to broadcast gruesome war footage from Ukraine.\n“A cyberattack was carried out on Russian TV broadcasting channels, because of which subscribers could have extremist inscriptions in the broadcast grid. Now our IT specialists are promptly eliminating the consequences of a hack so that subscribers can receive services and watch TV programs and movies as quickly as possible,” MTS representative in Siberia stated.\nAhead of Vladimir Putin’s address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky released a video to commemorate the Victory Day with this statement:\n“We won then. We will win now, too! And Khreshchatyk will see the parade of victory – the victory of Ukraine. Glory to Ukraine!”\nDDoS Attacks by Hacktivists Disrupted Russian Alcohol Supply Chain\nAttackers from the Ukrainian IT army successfully disrupted alcohol shipments in Russia by targeting EGAIS, the country’s primary online portal for alcohol distribution.\nAccording to Russian news portal Vedomosti, Ukrainian hacktivists took down Russia’s central alcohol distribution platform called Unified State Automated Alcohol Accounting Information System or EGAIS, with DDoS attacks launched on May 2nd and 3rd.\nEGAIS is an important portal since, as per the law, all alcohol producers and distributors must register their shipments at EGAIS. Therefore, an attack on this platform caused extensive service blockage across Russia.\nReportedly, three sites belonging to the platform received DDoS attacks. When checked on May 4th, two EGAIS sites gave the error “the server stopped responding,” and the third didn’t work.\nThe attacks began on May 2nd and the next day system failures became more obvious. Wine trader Fort claimed that service disruption occurred on May 4th while the Union of Alcohol Producers, Igor Kosarev, and Ladoga representative claimed the same.\nFort’s executive director, Alexander Lipilin, stated that 70% of the invoices failed to be uploaded to EGAIS on May 4th. Strong alcoholic beverages producer Beluga Group didn’t report any problems with EGAIS.\nThe problem got partially resolved on the morning of May 4th. Out of the 1,500 documents queued in Ladoga, 600 were sent to the system. The problem is expected to be fully fixed within the next two days.\nCIFFRA (Center for Research on Federal and Regional Alcohol Markets) director, Vadim Drobiz, stated that the EGAIS attack didn’t affect the end consumer as stores had stocked alcohol before the holidays.\nThe entire EGAIS system got paralyzed, and as a result, the alcohol supply chain was disrupted during the May holidays. Vedomosti further noted that the DDoS attacks continued until May 4th, due to which manufacturers and suppliers couldn’t contact technical support to address delays or fix invoices and complete orders.\nAccording to Russian news portal Vedomosti, shipments to retail chains failed for many companies; factories didn’t receive a tank full of alcohol while restaurants couldn’t upload receipts. \n“Due to a large-scale failure, factories cannot accept tanks with alcohol, and customers, stores, and distributors cannot receive finished products that have already been delivered to them,” Vedomosti reported.\nOne of the companies impacted by the closure of the EGAIS portal announced to suspend all purchases as its warehouses were full. The outage mainly affected Vodka distribution, but wine companies also reported service disruption.\nUkrainian hacktivists, particularly the Disbalancer group, claimed responsibility for the attack and announced their plans to launch more attacks on the platform. It is worth noting that the Ukrainian IT Army earlier announced to target EGAIS servers on its Telegram channel, including the portals check.egais.ru, egais.ru, and service.egais.ru. \nUkrainian IT Army is a special cyber force that recruits volunteers from across the globe to launch cyberattacks against Russian infrastructure\/entities.\nIntelBroker Leaks Alleged National Security Data Tied to US Contractor Acuity Inc.\nThe notorious IntelBroker hacker and their affiliates have leaked a trove of sensitive records, which they claim jeopardize the United States national security. The data, leaked on Breach Forums, is linked to US Federal contractor Acuity Inc., in a data breach allegedly carried out in March 2024. The data was previously being sold for just $3,000 in Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency.\nAs seen by Hackread.com, IntelBroker has classified the breach as a “National Security Documents Leak,” involving documents from the “Five Eyes Intelligence Group.” The leaked records now accessible to the public include highly sensitive information such as full names, email addresses, office numbers, personal cell numbers, email addresses (government, military, and Pentagon), classified information, and communications between the Five Eyes, 14 Eyes, and the US’s allies.\nFor your information, The Five Eyes Intelligence Group is an intelligence alliance including five English-speaking countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The alliance aims to share intelligence and collaborate on signals intelligence (SIGINT) gathering, surveillance, and cybersecurity activities.\nOn March 4, 2024, Hackread.com published an exclusive report on a data breach allegedly involving Acuity Inc., a federal contractor based in Reston, Virginia. The breach was claimed by IntelBroker.\nThe hacker claimed the use of a zero-day security vulnerability in GitHub to access Acuity Inc.’s tokens and facilitate their malicious activities, including the theft of data belonging to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nHackread.com reported the breach to GitHub, Acuity Inc., ICE, and USCIS. However, none of the organizations responded to the report. In contrast, Homeland Security, responding to a third-party media site that had not reported on the incident or analyzed the data, denied IntelBroker’s claims and labelled the breach as false, categorizing the leaked information as “test demos for vendors” with fake names and contact information used solely to provide examples of received data.\nDespite the US Government’s version that the data leak is fake, Hackread.com’s analysis suggests that the publicly leaked information remains highly consequential. Even if the data is fabricated, it exposes the modus operandi of US intelligence agencies and their allies, potentially risking their operational security and strategies.\n\nI will say again: data like this can’t be faked unless it’s copy paste from different and previous leaks which is highly unlikely based on IntelBroker’s previous attacks.Also, their availability on twitter should be good for OSINT researchers, no? https:\/\/t.co\/6CkYBp07Ua\nThe hacker’s origins and affiliates are unknown; however, according to the United States government, IntelBroker is alleged to be the perpetrator behind one of the T-Mobile data breaches.\nAdditionally, IntelBroker is known for targeting high-profile targets in the United States. Some of their previous data breaches include Las Angeles Intl. Airport, US DoD Documents, Staffing Giant Robert Half, Facebook Marketplace Database, DARPA-related accesses in General Electric breach, Weee! Grocery and several others.\nMassive Data Breach Exposes Info of 43 Million French Workers\nA large-scale data breach has compromised the personal information of a staggering 43 million French workers, raising concerns about identity theft and fraud. The attack is believed to have impacted around two-thirds of France’s population. The unclaimed cyberattack targeted two French employment agencies France Travail and Cap Emploi. \nOn March 13, 2024, French employment agency France Travail, previously called Pole Emploi, announced becoming the victim of a data breach that exposed the personal data of their registered users. This includes names, social security numbers, dates of birth, email, postal addresses, phone numbers, and user IDs.\nFrance Travail named another company Cap Emploi, a government employment service supporting people with disabilities, as the victim of this breach. France Travail confirmed that login credentials, passwords, and bank details are not at risk. \nOn March 8, the agency notified the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), the national data protection agency, and filed a police complaint after which a formal investigation was launched.\nInitial probing by the Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Cybercrime Brigade of the Paris Judicial Police Department revealed that a malicious actor gained unauthorized access to Cap Emploi’s systems on February 6, impersonating a Cap Emploi civil service officer. France Travail began noticing suspicious activity within its IT systems between 6 February and 5 March 2024. \nAccording to CNIL, a cyberattack on France Travail (francetravail.fr) could have potentially exposed data of those currently registered on the job seekers list, those registered over the last 20 years, and those with a candidate space on the platform. The company will notify impacted users individually.\nThe French cybersecurity community has criticised France Travail’s security shortcomings, with some professionals surprised that the agency took around a month to notify authorities and 20 years of users’ data being accessible online. \nWhile it is legally required to keep users’ data for a certain period, storing the oldest part in a secure backup repository is generally recommended. The CNIL has now initiated an investigation to assess the company’s compliance with data security measures with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nInterestingly, ethical hacker Olivier Laurelli (aka Bluetouff) attempted to publicly notify France Travail of security flaws in the agency’s new web application in February without receiving a response. The French government has warned of potential cyber threats, including phishing, scams, and identity theft, following the data breach.\n\nBonjour @FranceTravail on a bien rigolé ce weekend, mais on est d'accord que l'info est remontée et que vos équipes travaillent d'arrache pied à corriger ce truc avant qu'un drame national n'arrive ? https:\/\/t.co\/O7V4HCUqw1\nCNIL is urging French workers to remain vigilant and be cautious of any suspicious communication. They recommend monitoring bank statements closely for unusual activity and considering placing a fraud alert on credit reports. \nThis massive data breach comes as a significant blow to France’s reputation for data security, highlighting the need for stricter regulations and improved cybersecurity practices within French companies, particularly those handling sensitive employee data.\nFor insights into the data breach, we reached out to Nick Tausek, Lead Security Automation Architect at Swimlane who added, “The scale of this latest breach surpasses previous incidents, highlighting the ongoing challenges faced by governmental agencies entrusted with safeguarding the personal data of millions.” \n“To mitigate against these threats, organizations need to adopt a proactive cybersecurity approach. Investing in security platforms that centralize investigation and detection through the use of automation will allow security teams to respond to threats in real time and gain visibility across the SOC,” Nick advised.\nNissan Confirms Data Breach Affected 100,000 Customers and Employees\nNissan Motor Corporation’s Oceania region has confirmed a data breach impacting roughly 100,000 individuals. The breach, linked to a December 2023 cyberattack claimed by the Akira ransomware group, exposed the personal information of customers, dealers, and some current and former employees.\nFor your information, Nissan Motor Corporation and Nissan Financial Services in Australia and New Zealand were impacted by a cyberattack on December 5, 2023.\n“On 5 December 2023, a malicious third party obtained unauthorised access to our local IT servers. We took immediate action to contain the breach, and promptly alerted the relevant government authorities, including the Australian and New Zealand national cyber security centres and privacy regulators” Nissan revealed in an update released on 13 March 2024.\nAkira ransomware group claimed to have stolen 128 GB of information including corporate files and personal information. Other impacted businesses included Mitsubishi, Renault, Skyline, Infiniti, LDV, and RAM. Hackers then published files stolen from Nissan systems, indicating the company refused ransom demands.\nNissan detected the ‘disruptive incident’ the same month and notified customers but crucial details about data exfiltration weren’t confirmed until now. While the exact nature of the compromised data remains under investigation, Nissan acknowledges the possible leak of government-issued identification documents, names, and contact details. The company emphasizes that they are still validating contact information and removing duplicates, so the final number affected might be slightly lower.\nNissan Oceania has now started contacting the 100,000 affected individuals. The carmaker has reported that the type of information compromised in the breach might be different for each affected individual. \nThe company estimates that up to 10% of individuals may have had their government identification compromised, with the data set including 4,000 Medicare cards, 7,500 driver’s licenses, 220 passports, and 1,300 tax file numbers. The remaining 90% of the affectees Nissan is notifying have had other personal information impacted, including loan-related transaction statement copies, employment or salary information, and general information like dates of birth. \nThe company is providing support services to affected individuals and enhancing cybersecurity measures to prevent future incidents, while also offering free identity theft and credit services.\nNissan advises customers to remain vigilant and be cautious of any suspicious emails, calls, or text messages. They recommend monitoring financial statements for unauthorized activity and considering placing a fraud alert on their credit reports.\nCommenting on the news and providing insight, Erfan Shadabi, a cybersecurity expert at comforte AG said, “This data breach on Nissan demonstrates just how important it is for every organization to rethink data security. Nissan must now assess just how much sensitive information has been released.”\n“Hopefully, they can navigate this situation effectively with minimal damage. The distressing fact is that ordinary individuals and users invariably find themselves at the mercy of organizations failing to fortify their data against potential breaches. The fallout from such incidents can range from identity theft to financial losses, leaving users vulnerable to a myriad of cyber threats,” Shadabi warned.\n“The ironic thing is that enterprises can avoid the threat of leaked hijacked data simply by taking a data-centric approach to protecting sensitive information. Using tokenization or format-preserving encryption, businesses can obfuscate any sensitive data within their data ecosystem, rendering it incomprehensible no matter who has access to it. These reports should all be treated as cautionary tales, as any enterprise might find itself in the same boat without the proper data-centric approach,” he stressed.\nFakeUpdates Malware Campaign Targets WordPress – Millions of Sites at Risk\nAs of March 2024, approximately 835 million websites are utilizing the WordPress Content Management System (CMS). This vast presence makes WordPress an extremely lucrative target for cybercriminals.\nTo highlight the ongoing threats to WordPress, according to the February 2024 Global Threat Index released by Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.,  this week, researchers have uncovered a fresh wave of cyber threats including malware attacks aimed at WordPress websites.\nThe campaign, identified as FakeUpdates or SocGholish, involved compromising WordPress sites through hacked admin accounts. The malware employed various tactics, including modified versions of legitimate WordPress plugins, to infiltrate websites and deceive users into downloading a Remote Access Trojan.\nDespite efforts to combat it, FakeUpdates has persisted since at least 2017, posing a significant threat to website security. Some of the attack’s examples are previously identified incidents targeting products like Windows and Chrome browsers.\nIn the attack, the malware primarily targets websites with content management systems, aiming to trick users into downloading malicious software. Associated with the Russian cybercrime group Evil Corp, FakeUpdates is believed to generate revenue by selling access to infected systems.\nAs per the research shared with Hackread.com ahead of publication on Monday, Maya Horowitz, VP of Research at Check Point Software, emphasized the importance of protecting websites from cyber threats. \nShe highlighted the critical role websites play in modern society and the potential consequences of malware attacks on online presence and reputation. Horowitz stressed the need for proactive measures and a zero-tolerance approach to cybersecurity threats.\nCheck Point’s Global Threat Index also revealed insights into ransomware activities, including data from approximately 200 ransomware “shame sites” operated by double-extortion ransomware groups. \nLockbit3, despite its shutdown, not only returned also but remained the most prevalent ransomware group in February, responsible for 20% of reported incidents. Play and 8base followed closely, with 8% and 7% of incidents, respectively. Play, which entered the top three for the first time, was responsible for a recent cyberattack on the city of Oakland.\nAdditionally, the report highlighted the most exploited vulnerabilities globally in February. The “Web Servers Malicious URL Directory Traversal” vulnerability affected 51% of organizations, followed by “Command Injection Over HTTP” and “Zyxel ZyWALL Command Injection,” each impacting 50% of organizations.\nHere are 6 important tips to protect your WordPress website:\nChoose a reputable web hosting provider that prioritizes security measures. While choosing a hosting service, always look for features like the following:\nEquiLend Employee Data Breached After January Ransomware Attack\nFinancial technology firm EquiLend recently disclosed a data breach reportedly originating from a January ransomware attack. The attack, which according to Bloomberg’s report, is attributed to the LockBit ransomware group, compromised the personal information of EquiLend employees.\nThe claim that LockBit ransomware is involved in the incident is concerning for businesses, as the group, despite its shutdown, has not only resurfaced but is already targeting new victims.\nEquiLend initially reported a “technical issue” on January 24th, leading to service disruptions. The company later confirmed a ransomware attack but provided limited details. Recent notifications to affected individuals and authorities reveal the extent of the data breach.\nAccording to the notification sent by the company to impacted customers, the attack compromised sensitive employee data, including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and internal payroll information. EquiLend assures it has no evidence of this information being misused but is offering two years of complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to affected individuals.\nWhile client-facing services were restored by February 5th, the full impact of the attack remains unclear. Speculation suggests EquiLend may have negotiated with the attackers, but the company has not confirmed any ransom payment.\nIt’s worth noting that at the time of writing, LockBit’s dark web leak site showed no mention of EquiLend. This could indicate that negotiations have occurred, or the group has yet to list EquiLend on their website.\nEquiLend is working with cybersecurity experts to investigate the incident and prevent future occurrences. The company emphasizes its commitment to data security and is urging affected individuals to remain vigilant and monitor their financial statements for suspicious activity.\nFor insights, we reached out to Tamara Kirchleitner, Senior Intelligence Operations Analyst at Centripetal. “In the wake of this cyberattack, it’s a stark reminder of the relentless threat fintech firms face. Offering affected employees free identity theft protection is commendable, yet many companies remain reactive,” Tamara said. \n“This incident underscores the need for proactive cybersecurity measures. Implementing robust protocols is imperative in today’s digital landscape. Businesses must embrace advanced technologies to safeguard their systems and customer data. It’s time for a paradigm shift towards anticipatory cybersecurity,” she warned.\nThis incident highlights the growing threat of ransomware attacks and the importance of strong cybersecurity measures. Financial institutions like EquiLend handle sensitive data, making them prime targets for cybercriminals.\nEquiLend’s data breach should be a wakeup for organizations to prioritize data security investments and implement strong safeguards against cyberattacks.\nLeicester City Council’s IT System and Phones Down Amid Cyber Attack\nLeicester City Council continues to face disruption after a cyber attack forced them to shut down IT systems and phone lines last Thursday (March 7, 2024). While the nature of the attack remains undisclosed, officials are working alongside cybersecurity specialists and law enforcement to assess the damage and restore functionality.\n“This incident highlights the growing vulnerability of local authorities to cyber threats,” said Richard Sword, strategic director of city developments and neighbourhoods at Leicester City Council. “Our priority is to minimize disruption to critical services and get our systems back online as swiftly as possible.”\nThe council anticipates a phased recovery process, prioritizing the restoration of essential services by midweek. Residents seeking urgent assistance can utilize the emergency phone lines established on the council’s website.\nThe shutdown has caused significant inconvenience for residents. Essential services like council tax payments and license renewals are currently unavailable. Local Green Party councillor Patrick Kitterick expressed concern, stating the prolonged outage poses a serious challenge, especially considering the council’s role in civil emergency response.\nSince it’s not clear whether the incident was a ransomware attack or a DDoS attack, we reached out to William Wright, CEO of Closed Door Security, for his insights. Given the history of cyber attacks on local councils, William cautioned that this might turn out to be a costly and disruptive ransomware attack.\n“We don’t know what type of attack Leicester City Council is suffering from but given the recent spate of ransomware attacks targeting public authorities, it’s likely to be ransomware,” William said.\nHe warned that the government must take action to tackle the vulnerable situation. “Earlier this week, the government responded to a report from a Parliamentary Committee on ransomware, which said it was not doing enough to keep the country safe from the threat, but the government didn’t agree with the findings, maybe this latest attack on Leicester City Council will act as a wake-up call.” \nLeicester City Council is expected to provide updates on the situation as progress is made. Residents are encouraged to visit the council’s website for the latest information and alternative contact methods.\nThis attack comes amidst a concerning trend targeting local government bodies across the UK. The incident also goes on to show the need for basic cybersecurity measures including employee training to protect critical infrastructure from sophisticated cyber threats.\nRussian Midnight Blizzard Hackers Breached Microsoft Source Code\nMicrosoft has been hit by a significant cybersecurity breach, with the company confirming that Russian hackers infiltrated its infrastructure, compromising valuable source code.\nThe breach, originally discovered on January 12, 2024, and reported on January 19, raised concerns about the potential misuse of proprietary information and the security of millions of users relying on Microsoft’s products and services.\nEarlier this year, Microsoft disclosed that Russian state-sponsored hackers referred to as Midnight Blizzard (also known as Nobelium, Cozy Bear, and APT29), have been spying on the email accounts of Microsoft’s team members. The group, known for the devastating SolarWinds attack, successfully stole source code in what Microsoft now terms an “ongoing attack.”\nReportedly, the hackers infiltrated a “small percentage of corporate email accounts” and stole internal messages and files in an attack that began in late November 2023. The threat actor compromised a non-production test tenant account using a password spray attack, accessing some Microsoft corporate email accounts, including senior leadership and cybersecurity employees, and exfiltrating emails and documents. \nThe attackers exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s defences, gaining unauthorized access to a substantial portion of source code, including Windows OS components, Office Suite, and other critical software elements.\nPreviously, Microsoft stated that there was no evidence that the “threat actor had any access to customer environments, production systems, source code, or AI systems.” However, as per Microsoft’s update published on March 8, 2024, Midnight Blizzard is using information from corporate email systems to gain unauthorized access, including access to source code repositories and internal systems. Still, the company asserts that there’s no evidence that attackers compromised Microsoft-hosted customer-facing systems.\nMidnight Blizzard is using various tactics to attack Microsoft, some of which were shared between Microsoft and its customers via emails. Moreover, the company claims hackers increased the attack volume, such as password sprays, by up to 10 times in February compared to January.\nMicrosoft has increased security investments and coordinated cross-enterprise efforts to counter Midnight Blizzard’s persistent threat. The company is enhancing its security controls, detections, and monitoring, as well as conducting ongoing investigations into the group’s activities. \nHackread will continue to share findings and information as they evolve. Users are advised to implement security updates, report suspicious activity, and adhere to security best practices.\nAriel Parnes, former Head of the Israeli Intelligence Service Cyber Department, winner of the Israel Defense Prize for tech innovations in the cyber field, and COO and Co-Founder at SaaS incident response leader, Mitiga, shared the following insights with Hackread.com:\n“For advanced nation-state cyber groups, access to a company’s source code is akin to finding the master key to its digital kingdom, opening up avenues for finding new zero-day vulnerabilities: undiscovered security flaws that can be exploited before they’re known to the software creators or the public.”\nAriel warned that “Zero-day vulnerabilities represent a critical threat because there’s no straightforward way to detect them until after they’ve been discovered and disclosed by the software creators. Given this challenging landscape, organizations need to double down on cybersecurity measures focused on proactive defence.”\nHacker Claims Breaching US Federal Contractor Acuity, Selling ICE, USCIS Data\nThe notorious hacker known as IntelBroker has claimed responsibility for a recent data breach allegedly targeting Acuity Inc., a Federal contractor based in Reston, Virginia. The breach has resulted in the theft of sensitive data and documents from two prominent U.S. government entities: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). \nFor your information, Acuity Inc. is a federal technology consulting firm headquartered in Reston, Virginia. They offer their deep industry expertise to federal agencies, particularly those focused on National Security and Public Safety. According to the company, their core mission is to help these agencies plan for the future, improve their ability to serve citizens and deliver measurable results through innovative technology solutions and proven management techniques.\nThese alarming claims surfaced in a recent post on Breach Forums, a notorious cybercrime and hacker forum. Hackread.com has exclusively confirmed that the stolen data is currently being offered for sale on the forum for a mere $3,000 in Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency.\nFollowing the breach announcement on Breach Forums, IntelBroker proceeded to showcase a sample of the alleged stolen data, purportedly containing personal and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of over 100,000 victims. The showcased records include:\nAccording to the hacker, “everything belongs to the US citizens,” implying that the compromised data contains information about civilians as well as government agents.\nIn addition to the information available on the forum, Hackread.com gained insight into further sensitive data, including source code, user manual, confidential conversations and feedback exchanged between ICE agents and contractors. This extended to discussions on investigative techniques such as those utilized by the Five Eyes alliance, the Ukraine, and Russia conflict, information on terrorism-related seminars globally, etc.\nIntelBroker informed us that a collection of data labelled as ‘Top Secret’, ‘Classified’, ‘Unclassified’, and ‘FOUO’ (For Official Use Only) has been uncovered. The hacker has already shared a screenshot illustrating the sensitive nature of this data on Breach Forum.\nMoreover, the alleged compromised data includes .GOV-hosted emails containing plain-text passwords for some. It’s worth noting, however, that these accounts are protected by Two-factor Authentication (2FA), and any unauthorized attempts to access them are promptly blocked until a valid code is provided. \nGiven the highly sensitive nature of this information, Hackread.com has refrained from sharing some screenshots and has redacted sample data accordingly. It’s essential to emphasise that, at no point, did Hackread.com attempt to access these accounts.\nIn an exclusive conversation with the hacker, Hackread.com learned that they had exploited a critical 0-day vulnerability in GitHub. Despite not disclosing technical details of the Proof of Concept (PoC) regarding the alleged vulnerability, the hacker claimed that this flaw enables attackers to steal GitHub tokens and advance their malicious activities.\nIn response to these developments, Hackread.com has initiated contact with GitHub, ICE, USCIS, and Acuity Inc. to request their comments on the matter.\nIntelBroker is known for targeting high-profile targets in the United States. Some of their previous data breaches include Las Angeles Intl. Airport, US DoD Documents, Staffing Giant Robert Half, Facebook Marketplace Database, DARPA-related accesses in General Electric breach, Weee! Grocery and several others.\nIn fact, according to the United States government, IntelBroker is also the hacker behind one of the T-Mobile data breaches.\nThe aftermath of Acuity Inc.’s alleged breach carries potentially severe and long-lasting repercussions. The compromised data, if obtained by nations deemed adversarial by the United States, could pose significant risks to national security. The exploitation of such intelligence-related information may jeopardize the safety of agents and officials, as well as compromise ongoing operations.\nMoreover, recent events highlight the vulnerability posed by third-party contractors. Just recently, on March 4th, 2024, American Express disclosed that its cardholders had been affected by a significant data breach originating from a third-party vendor.\nIn August 2023, an IT contractor employed by the Metropolitan Police Force experienced a cyberattack that impacted over 50,000 MET police personnel.\nIn September 2023, a third-party contractor experienced a data breach that affected over 8,000 Greater Manchester Police Officers. In October 2023, another contractor inadvertently exposed their database, resulting in the leakage of sensitive details about 500,000 Irish Police vehicle seizure records.\nChinese Evasive Panda Targets Tibetans with Nightdoor Backdoor\nA Chinese-backed hacking group, Evasive Panda (also known as BRONZE HIGHLAND and Daggerfly), has launched a cyberespionage campaign targeting Tibetans globally. The operation, detected in January 2024 by ESET researchers, began in September 2023 and uses a two-fold attack strategy: Watering hole attacks and spreading backdoor.\nA watering hole attack is a cyberattack strategy where hackers compromise websites that their target victims frequently visit. By injecting malicious code into these websites, the attackers can infect the devices of unsuspecting visitors. \nThis tactic relies on the trust users have in the compromised websites, leading them to unknowingly download malware or provide sensitive information, making it an effective method for targeting specific groups or organizations.\nEvasive Panda capitalized on the Monlam Festival, a major Tibetan Buddhist event, by compromising the festival’s website. This “watering hole” attack tricked visitors from specific networks into downloading malware disguised as legitimate software. \nAs detailed in ESET’s comprehensive technical blog post, the attackers also compromised the Tibetan news website Tibetpost to distribute malicious payloads, including backdoors for Windows and unknown malware for macOS.\nThe attackers used a mix of known and unknown tools, including the custom-made Windows backdoor “Nightdoor” alongside the previously linked MgBot malware. This variety suggests a well-equipped and resourceful group.\nBy exploiting software vulnerabilities and compromising online platforms, Evasive Panda aimed to infiltrate targeted networks. The campaign’s timing, coinciding with the Monlam Festival, highlights their attempt to exploit increased online activity during religious events.\nThe recent discovery of Evasive Panda’s cyber-espionage campaign targeting Tibetans is consistent with previous actions by Chinese hackers. These groups have a track record of targeting Tibetan communities. Additionally, similar tactics have been used in the past to target Uyghurs, employing evasive Android malware for their malicious activities.\nXplain Hack Aftermath: Play Ransomware Leaks Sensitive Swiss Government Data\nFollowing the cyberattack on Swiss IT service provider, Xplain, details of the leaked data have been disclosed in a press release from the Swiss National Center for Cybersecurity (NCSC) – The Federal Office for Cybersecurity (BACS) has also taken part in the investigation.\nThe department analyzed the data leaked stolen by the Play ransomware group from Xplain, which is a “major provider of IT services to national and cantonal authorities,” the department confirmed.\nBack in May 2023, hackers exploited a vulnerability to target Xplain servers hosting applications for cantonal services, blocking access until a key or unblocking tool is sent in exchange for ransom. The attack, carried out by the Play ransomware group, had far-reaching consequences, impacting the Federal Office of Police, the Federal Office of Customs and Border Protection, Swiss Federal Railways and Aargau cantonal authorities.\nIn June 2023, Swiss federal government websites and the Swiss Federal Railways’ online portal were targeted in DDoS attacks, causing several websites to be unavailable. The finance ministry reported on 12 June 2023 that a pro-Russian group, “NoName,” claimed responsibility for the attack on its Telegram channel and that no data was lost in the attack. This group was also involved in the attack on the Swiss parliament website earlier in June 2023.\nThe Play ransomware group leaked around 65,000 documents belonging to the federal government, including classified documents and login credentials, which were published on its dark web leak site on 14 June 2023. \nAs per NCSC’s press release published earlier today, the BACS then took over the coordination of incident response within the federal administration and analysis of leaked data. A policy strategy crisis team was formed on 28 June and an administrative investigation was launched officially on 23 August to find out details of data leak at Xplain.\nThe BACS emphasized that the report focuses on data types and analysis challenges, not the content of leaked data. Around 70% (around 47,413) of files belong to Xplain and 14% (9,040) to the Federal Administration.  Hackers have leaked 95% of the 9040 files belonging to the Swiss federal government, mainly from the Federal Department of Justice and Police, Federal Office of Justice, Federal Office of Police, State Secretariat for Migration, and ISC-FDJP. \nAround half of the Federal Administration’s files contain sensitive content like personal data, technical information, classified information, and passwords, with 4,779 files containing personal data, and 278 files containing technical information. 121 objects were dubbed classified under the Information Protection Ordinance with 4 of them containing readable passwords.\nThe department aims to collaborate with authorities and Xplain to address potential consequences. This investigation is expected to be completed in March 2024.\nThe Play ransomware group is believed to be based in Russia and is responsible for around 300 successful attacks on businesses and critical infrastructure in North America, South America, and Europe from June 2022 to October 2023. The group uses a double extortion model, ranging from unauthorized access to external services like RDP and VPN.\nTycoon and Storm-1575 Linked to Phishing Attacks on US Schools\nPublic schools across the United States are facing a surge in sophisticated phishing campaigns, according to a new report by PIXM, a cybersecurity firm specializing in artificial intelligence solutions. \nThreat actors launch targeted spear phishing attacks using stealthy attack patterns to target officials at large US school districts, bypassing MFA protections.\nThe report highlights a worrying trend: attackers are increasingly employing tactics to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), a security measure previously thought to offer robust protection. \nSince December 2023, a surge in MFA-based phishing campaigns targeting US teachers, staff, and administrators has been observed, using dadsec and Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) platforms to compromise administrator email accounts and deliver ransomware, researchers noted.\nPIXM discovered phishing activity in November 2023 and linked it to Tycoon and Storm-1575 threat groups. These groups were singled out because of their common attack pattern. Both actors use social engineering techniques, spoofing emails to appear legitimate and using AiTM (Adversary-in-the-Middle) phishing to bypass MFA tokens and session cookies. \nThey also create customized login experiences and use dadsec and phisingkit PhaaS services to point at legitimate sites. Their infrastructure, including C2 servers, domain generation algorithms, legitimate hosting services, and SSL certificates, allows them to control large numbers of phishing websites and avoid detection.\nFor your information, The Tycoon Group’s PaaS, available on Telegram for just $120, boasts key features like bypassing Microsoft’s two-factor authentication. On the other hand, Microsoft identifies Storm-1575 as a threat actor engaging in phishing campaigns through the Dadsec platform. They employ numerous Domain Generated Algorithm domains to host credential harvesting pages, targeting global organizations to extract Microsoft 365 credentials.\nIn the attacks, as detailed by PIXM in a blog post, targeted officials received phishing emails prompting them to update passwords. This led to encountering a Cloudflare Captcha and a spoofed Microsoft password page. If unthwarted, attackers would forward passwords to legitimate login pages, requesting two-factor authentication codes, and bypassing MFA protections. \nCommon targets include the Chief of Human Capital and multiple finance and payroll administrator accounts. Some attacks attempted to alter Windows registry keys, potentially infecting machines with malicious scripts. The attacks concealed their tracks using stealth tactics like hiding behind Cloudflare infrastructure and spinning up new domains.\nThe use of CAPTCHAs in phishing attacks can delay the delivery of the payload and provide a sense of legitimacy to end users. However, there is also a potential for malicious trojan activity, such as modifying Windows registry keys for the VBS file format and injecting a malicious file’script.vbs’. These attacks can be used for malware installation, ransomware, and data exfiltration. \nWhile schools are the most targeted industry by ransomware gangs, student data has also been a prominent prey of cybercrime, but the extensiveness of data loss noticed recently is unprecedented. It is estimated that over 900 schools were targeted in MOVEit-linked cyber attacks.\nA data leak involving Raptor Technologies in January 202, reported by cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler, exposed around 4,024,001 sensitive records belonging to students, parents, and staff, raising concerns about student privacy and school safety. \nJust one month later, in February 2024, Fowler discovered a non-password-protected database storing 210,020 records or 153.76 GB of data, containing sensitive information like full names, addresses, phone numbers, and tax records of students and parents, associated with the Online Voucher Application.\nTo protect against such phishing attacks, organizations should identify high-priority staff with sensitive access or regular communication patterns, invest in tailored awareness efforts, arm users with caution against links and websites prompting MFA tokens and CAPTCHAs, and implement proactive AI-driven protections at the browser and email layers.\nAfter Denial, AT&T Confirms Data Breach Affecting 73 Million Users\nAT&T has finally confirmed a massive data breach impacting a whopping 73 million (73,481,539) current and former customers. This comes after weeks of speculation and accusations of a cover-up following the discovery of the leaked data on the the notorious hacking and cybercrime platform BreachForums.\nThe data breach, which involved Social Security numbers, passcodes, and potentially other personal information, was first discovered in mid-March. Cybersecurity researchers immediately noted similarities to a possible breach from 2021 that AT&T never acknowledged.\nThe data was leaked on Sunday, March 17, 2024. However, AT&T initially denied any data breaches, despite reports from security researchers like Troy Hunt, founder of Have I Been Pwned. Hunt pointed out that the leaked data closely resembled a breach from 2021 that was attempted to be sold online by a hacker known as “Shiny Hunters.”\nThis denial raised concerns about AT&T’s transparency and potential legal ramifications. Experts pointed out that failing to disclose a data breach promptly could violate consumer protection laws.\nUnder mounting pressure, AT&T finally confirmed the data breach on March 30th. The company stated they were unaware of the source of the breach, suggesting it could have originated from AT&T’s systems or a vendor. \nThey also announced that they had already reset passcodes for current users and would be reaching out to impacted individuals. Additionally, AT&T will be offering complimentary identity theft and credit monitoring services.\n“Based on our preliminary analysis, the data set appears to be from 2019 or earlier, impacting approximately 7.6 million current AT&T account holders and 65.4 million former account holders.”\nWhile AT&T has confirmed the breach, questions remain.\nAT&T has yet to address these questions publicly. It’s likely that the company will face lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny in the coming months.\nThanks for reaching out. A number of AT&T passcodes have been compromised. Our teams are working with external cybersecurity experts to analyze the situation and we have reset passcodes.

Consumers should remain vigilant and take steps to protect their personal information, such as monitoring credit reports and using strong, unique passwords.\nAmerican Express Cardholders Impacted by Third-Party Vendor Data Breach\nAmerican Express notified card members today of a data breach impacting some customer information, emphasizing that its systems were not compromised. The breach originated from a third-party service provider used by numerous merchants, potentially exposing customer details including card numbers, names, and expiration dates.\nAmerican Express discovered unauthorized access to a system utilized by a third-party service provider engaged by various merchants. This incident may have compromised the account information of some American Express card members.\nAmerican Express has filed a data breach notification with the state of Massachusetts regarding potential impacts on cardholder information, which may include current or previously issued American Express card numbers, cardholder names, and card information such as expiration dates. \nIn response to this situation, American Express has taken several measures to address the issue. The company has affirmed the security of its own systems and is actively monitoring accounts for any signs of fraudulent activity. \nAdditionally, cardholders are reassured that they are not liable for unauthorized charges. American Express has provided resources and information on fraud protection through its Security Center website. \nFor insights into this, we reached out to Piyush Pandey, CEO at Pathlock who stated, “Over the last few years, we’ve seen a significant uptick in third-party data breaches. In this example, there are multiple parties, or what we call “nth party” risk. This places a much greater emphasis on organizations to vet their third parties during onboarding to minimize access risk.”\nPiyush also cautioned businesses about the importance of scrutinizing third parties before entering into business partnerships with them. “Organizations must also ensure that the third-party partners of the third parties they are doing business with are assessed for access risk. It should become part of standard third-party contracts to specify breach response responsibilities,” he explained. “Masking data to provide only what is needed by third parties to provide services must be a best practice.”\nNevertheless, American Express card members are advised to review their account statements for any suspicious activity, especially over the next 12-24 months. They are also encouraged to enable account notifications via the American Express Mobile app or through email\/text messaging for added security. \nFurthermore, updating contact information with American Express is recommended to ensure smooth communication if necessary.\nThe beginning of 2024 has witnessed a noticeable uptick in data breaches affecting diverse sectors, including corporate entities and governmental organizations. On February 23 2024, a threat actor using the alias IntelBroker leaked 2.4 million data belonging to private plane owners linked to the Los Angeles International Airport.\nIn August 2023, an IT contractor employed by the Metropolitan Police Force experienced a cyberattack that impacted over 50,000 MET police personnel.\nIn September 2023, a third-party contractor experienced a data breach that affected over 8,000 Greater Manchester Police Officers. In October 2023, another contractor inadvertently exposed their database, resulting in the leakage of sensitive details about 500,000 Irish Police vehicle seizure records.\nResurrecAds Attack Hijacks Brand Names, Spreads Spam Via ‘SubdoMailing’\nGuardio Labs is monitoring a campaign called SubdoMailing, which has been circulating spam and phishing emails since September 2022. The campaign, attributed to a threat actor called ResurrecAds, manipulates the digital advertising ecosystem by resuscitating dead domains associated with big brands – A malicious practice also known as Brand Hijacking.\nThe scam was detected after Guardio Labs’ email protection systems discovered unusual patterns in email metadata mainly related to SMTP servers that are authenticated as legitimate senders. This led Guardio to launch an investigation into the SMTP protocol, domain hunting, and DNS scanning tools. \nThe ResurrecAds incident mirrors a prior case where, in November 2022, cybersecurity researchers at Cyjax uncovered 42,000 phishing domains posing as well-known brands, distributing malware for ad revenue.\nThe team discovered an unprecedented subdomain hijacking operation, where thousands of hijacked sub-domains were used to send spammy and malicious emails, falsely authorized under international brands. The campaign uses the trust in these domains to circulate spam and phishing emails, bypassing security measures. \nThe emails can also circumvent the Sender Policy Framework (SPF), an email authentication method, and pass DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) checks to prevent messages from being marked as spam.\nGuardio researchers discovered over 8,000 domains from renowned brands\/institutions (MSN, VMware, McAfee, The Economist, Cornell University, CBS, Marvel, eBay). Researchers dubbed this activity “SubdoMailing,” which exploits users’ trust to circulate spammy phishing emails.\nThey called it a classic subdomain hijacking scheme because it involves scanning and enumerating domains for forgotten subdomains, registering them, and using SPF records to send malicious emails. This can lead to unauthorized access to SMTP servers and valuable assets for hackers.\nThe sample email researchers analyzed was disguised as an image to bypass spam filters, trigger click-redirects through various domains, targeting device type and location to display content tailored to maximize profit. This unique scheme raises questions about how it bypasses authentication and security checks with major email providers.\nThe evidence suggests a single threat actor, “ResurrecAds,” is responsible for a large-scale operation scanning the internet for “vulnerable domains, identifying opportunities, purchasing domains, securing hosts and IP addresses, and orchestrating email dissemination,” researchers noted. \nTheir strategy involves reviving domains affiliated with big brands, exploiting legitimate services and brands, and circumventing email protection measures, demonstrating their sophisticated technical sophistication.\nThe study revealed thousands of active cases of CNAME-takeover and SPF-takeover, which involve stealing abandoned domains of old email\/marketing services. These attacks have been ongoing for at least two years, allowing attackers to easily inject their IPs into the domain’s SPF records using the main domain name as the sender.\n“Given these sophisticated tactics, we’re clearly facing a formidable operation characterized by significant expenditure and substantial revenue.”\nResearchers have launched a “SubdoMailing” checker website, enabling domain administrators and site owners to quickly identify and address any abuse detected, ensuring domain security.\nLoanDepot Ransomware Attack Leads to Data Breach; 17 Million Impacted\nDetails surrounding the attack remain limited, but LoanDepot acknowledges unauthorized access to their systems, potentially compromising sensitive customer data. While the specific types of information exposed haven’t been confirmed, the letter sent to the victims of the data breach suggests it could include their full name, address, email address, financial account numbers, social security number, phone number, and date of birth.\nLoanDepot estimates that approximately 16.9 million (16,924,071) individuals have been affected. This includes current and former customers, as well as individuals who inquired about loan products but ultimately did not pursue them. \nThe company has begun notifying affected parties through letters and emails, outlining the potential scope of the breach and offering resources to help them protect themselves.\nLoanDepot took immediate action to contain the attack and secure their systems. They launched an investigation in collaboration with cybersecurity experts and notified law enforcement authorities. Additionally, the company has offered one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to all impacted individuals.\nThe full extent of the damage caused by this attack remains unclear. The potential for identity theft and financial fraud is a significant concern for millions of individuals.\nLoanDepot is urging affected individuals to remain alert and take proactive steps to safeguard their personal information, including being cautious of suspicious emails or phone calls, monitoring credit reports for unauthorized activity, and considering placing a freeze on their credit files.\nThe LoanDepot data breach is likely to attract scrutiny from regulators and may lead to legal repercussions. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is responsible for enforcing data privacy regulations, and they may investigate the incident to determine if LoanDepot followed appropriate data security practices. Further, affected individuals may have legal recourse against LoanDepot for failing to protect their personal information.\nFor insights into the LoanDepot data breach, we reached out to Javvad Malik, Lead Security Awareness Advocate at KnowBe4 who stated “This breach at LoanDepot is a reminder of the far-reaching consequences of ransomware attacks and it’s concerning to see the scale and sensitivity of the data involved, particularly the inclusion of Social Security numbers, which opens up Pandora’s box of identity theft and financial fraud possibilities.”\nJavvad emphasised the importance of employee training within the organisations especially those responsible for data handling. “This incident highlights the critical need for organizations, especially those handling vast amounts of personal information, to invest in strong cybersecurity measures, including threat detection, response strategies, and most importantly, providing employees with timely and relevant security awareness and training.”\nWhile the LoanDepot data breach was confirmed in January 2024, the specific ransomware group responsible for the attack hasn’t been officially disclosed by the company or law enforcement agencies as of today, February 26, 2024.\nNevertheless, ransomware is one of the most prevalent threats to organizations of all sizes. While the United States has vowed to take strict measures against ransomware groups, with LockBit ransomware’s recent demise and resurrection, it is obvious that these groups are here to stay and plan to cause long-term damage.\nWhile the immediate aftermath of the LoanDepot data breach is concerning, the company’s commitment to transparency and its efforts to mitigate the damage are positive steps. Individuals must remain informed, take appropriate precautions, and actively monitor their financial information to minimize the potential impact of this incident.\nHackers Leak 2.5M Private Plane Owners’ Data Linked to LA Intl. Airport Breach\nEditor’s Note: The sample data image has been removed from the article upon request from one of the impacted clients.\nThe notorious hacker known as IntelBroker is making headlines once again with a daring alleged breach targeting one of the United States’ most critical organizations: the Los Angeles International Airport.\nIn a bold move, IntelBroker claims to have breached the database of the Los Angeles International Airport, making off with a trove of confidential user data belonging to private plane owners – The breach, according to the hacker, took place in February 2024.\nIt is important to note that no customer or traveller data is involved in this breach. However, the incident has apparently resulted in the compromise of a significant 2.5 million records, including sensitive information such as:\nThe breach was publicly disclosed by IntelBroker on the notorious hacker and cybercrime platform Breach Forums, adding another high-profile hack to their already extensive. Notable targets of IntelBroker’s previous hacks include the Weee! Grocery platform, General Electric, Staffing Giant Robert Half, and a recent data leak involving a partial Facebook Marketplace database.\nUpon learning of the breach, Hackread.com promptly reached out to IntelBroker, who confirmed their involvement and provided limited insight into their methods. According to IntelBroker, they exploited a vulnerability in the airport’s Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system (CRM system) to gain unauthorized access to the database, highlighting the critical need for organizations to strengthen their cybersecurity measures in the face of growing threats from skilled hackers like IntelBroker.\nThe screenshot below, obtained from Breach Forums, displays the listing of the data breach. It is important to highlight that the breach details attribute the hack to a user named “kwillsy.” However, in a statement to Hackread.com, IntelBroker clarified that “kwillsy” is not associated with the breach, and they take full responsibility for the hack.\nHackread.com has contacted the relevant authorities at the LA Airport, and this article will be updated accordingly pending their response.\nDuring the initial months of 2024, there has been a marked surge in data breaches impacting various sectors, encompassing both corporate entities and governmental bodies. Last week, Infosys disclosed a breach that affected more than 57,000 Bank of America customers.\nIn earlier weeks of the same month, two prominent US insurance firms, Washington National Insurance Company and Bankers Life and Casualty Company, reported breaches linked to SIM-swapping incidents, impacting over 66,000 customers collectively.\nIn January, Jason’s Deli encountered a significant breach, exposing the personal details of over 344,000 users due to a successful credential-stuffing attack. Concurrently, hackers targeted Indian ISP Hathway, compromising the personal information and KYC records of over 4 million unsuspecting customers.\nIsraeli El Al Alleges Hackers Targeted Flights in Mid-Air Hijack Attempt\nIn the past week, hackers targeted two El Al flights bound for Israel, attempting to hijack their communication networks and divert the aircraft, as reported by The Jerusalem Post. The flights were en route from Thailand to Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport. It is worth noting that no group has claimed responsibility for this hack.\nIn the most recent incident, Israel’s national airline confirmed that “hostile elements” attempted to take over the communication network of an El Al plane from Phuket, Thailand to Ben-Gurion Airport, causing it to divert from its destination. Hostile elements contacted pilots twice, once on a flight between Phuket and Ben-Gurion and once on a Bangkok flight.\nThe aircraft was reportedly flying over an area inhabited by Iranian-backed Houthis. Sources claim the hack may be the work of a Somaliland-based group. For your information, Somaliland is a state in the Horn of Africa.\nEl Al pilots became suspicious and decided to ignore the sudden change in instructions and switched to another communication channel to double-check their route with air traffic controllers. The airline confirmed that pilots are trained to spot and mitigate threats while in the air. According to the airline, the disruption did not affect the normal course of the flight due to the professionalism of the pilots. \nAttempted attack on the communications network of an Israeli flight from Phuket, ThailandHostile elements tried \"to manipulate the crew, the pilots, into changing the trajectory and diverting the flight to what would have been a hostile area,\" @guyaz explainsWith @benitalevin pic.twitter.com\/kJhedqzwbJ\n“The disruption did not affect the normal course of the flight thanks to the professionalism of the pilots who used the alternative means of communication and allowed the flight to continue on the planned route,” the airline’s statement read.\nAircraft safety should be a point of concern within the cybersecurity fraternity given the growing number of incidents targeting airlines. In September 2022, researchers at Necrum Security Labs discovered two critical vulnerabilities in Contec’s wireless LAN devices, specifically the Flexlan FXA3000 and FXA2000 series, which provide WiFi on airplanes. \nThe Japan-based Flexlan LAN devices in airplanes contained two critical vulnerabilities, CVE–2022–36158 and CVE–2022–36159, allowing hackers to hack the inflight entertainment system and other high-speed internet access points.\nThen in January 2024, Pen Test Partners’ cybersecurity researchers identified a critical issue in Airbus’ Flysmart+ Manager suite, which was remediated 19 months after initial disclosure. \nThe app, according to Pen Test Partners, developed by Airbus-owned IT services company NAVBLUE, had a disabled security control, allowing insecure communication with servers, potentially allowing an attacker to modify aircraft performance data or adjust airport information.\nEASA, the EU’s aviation safety agency, recently released the first Easy Access Rules for Information Security to enforce security best practices across various sectors, including suppliers, airlines, airports, communication infrastructure providers, and air towers.\nCrypto Exchange FixedFloat Hacked: $26 Million in BTC, ETH Stolen\nFixedFloat, a decentralized crypto exchange, has been hacked for at least $26 million worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The attack, initially attributed to minor technical issues, has led to frozen transactions and missing funds. \nFor your information, FixedFloat is an automated crypto exchange with 26% of its web traffic coming from the US. It integrates with Lightning Network for Bitcoin transactions.\nAs seen by Hackread.com, users reported frozen transactions and missing funds on the X exchange since February 17, with 409 Bitcoin (Approximately $21 million) and 1,728 Ether tokens (approximately $4.7 million) drained on February 18. \nThe exchange is investigating the security incident. FixedFloat’s website is also displaying an error message on all pages, stating “ERROR – Technical work is underway, we will be back soon! If you need to contact us, you can do this via chat.”\nThe stolen funds were sent to the Ethereum exchange. Threat researcher going by the X (formerly Twitter) handle of “Officer’s Notes” revealed that the hacker first transferred ETH to different ETH addresses and finally moved them to the eXch exchange. They then sent funds to two HitBTC addresses, which received their initial ETH deposits in 2021. This seems to be an attempt to create a false trail.\n\n. @FixedFloat hacked, resulting in ~1,728 ETH (worth ~$4.85m) and & 409 BTC (worth ~$21m) stolen. The drainer already transferred most of the stolen ETH to eXch on Ethereum. 26M$ loss in total!Drainer on Ethereum (1700 ETH stolen): 0x85c4fF99bF0eCb24e02921b0D4b5d336523Fa085… https:\/\/t.co\/imeXB1h7Jv pic.twitter.com\/oquw373NOG\n“I don’t see any addresses (other than the hacker’s address) that link these 2 HitBTC deposit addresses…Most likely, the hacker created only a false trail,” the researcher explained on X (Twitter). This was confirmed by the Web3 security platform Cyvers on X as well.\nThe cryptocurrency exchange confirmed it was an external attack, rubbishing rumours of insider involvement. Users and analysts initially claimed FixedFloat developers were behind the hacking, but the exchange denied any internal involvement.\nAlthough the company is yet to reveal the core information on how it happened, cybersecurity researchers are positive that the hack was caused by vulnerabilities and insufficient security measures, allowing the attacker to bypass defences and access core service functions. \nAs to what type of vulnerabilities, researchers believe that it was a wallet drainer attack. A wallet drainer attack is a malicious technique employed by cybercriminals to steal cryptocurrency from unsuspecting victims’ wallets. It typically involves exploiting vulnerabilities in smart contracts or tricking users into granting unauthorized access to their funds.\nFixedFloat stated that no user funds were affected, but the hack affected 30 outstanding orders, which the exchange will pay as soon as its services resume.\nFixedFloat faced criticism for not reporting the hack immediately, while the company maintains it was focusing on minimizing loss and eliminating vulnerabilities. The platform expects full operations to resume soon and release a detailed report after the investigation is complete.\nNevertheless, it is concerning that cryptocurrency exchanges have become a prominent target of scammers lately. Last month Group-IB Global Pvt. Ltd. disclosed details of a phishing operation dubbed Inferno Drainer targeting cryptocurrency wallet providers. The scammers targeted over 100 brands and 16,000 malicious domains, stealing over $80 million in digital assets from November 2022 to November 2023. The team reaped $87 million in illicit profits and scammed over 137,000 victims.\nIn June 2023, Pink Drainer, a notorious hacker group, successfully executed a series of high-profile Discord and Twitter hacks targeting projects like Evomos, Pika Protocol, OpenAI CTO, and Orbiter Finance. Online scam detector ScamSniffer confirmed Pink Drainer stole around $3 million from nearly 1,932 victims.\nRussian Hackers Hit Mail Servers in Europe for Political and Military Intel\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group has identified TAG-70, a potential threat actor allegedly working for Belarus and Russia, targeting government, military, and infrastructure entities across Europe and Central Asia since December 2020. The latest round of attacks was observed between October and December 2023.\nThe group is also known as Winter Vivern, TA-473, and UAC-0114. According to Insikt Group’s report (PDF), Tag-70 was discovered exploiting cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail servers across Europe. \nThe group mainly targeted government, military, and national infrastructure in Georgia, Poland, and Ukraine whereas targets were also observed in Belgium, France, the Czech Republic, Germany, and the UK. \nTAG-70, reportedly, used social engineering techniques to gain unauthorized access to mail servers across 80 organizations, including the Iranian Embassies in Moscow and the Netherlands, and the Georgia Embassy in Sweden. \nThe campaign aimed to gather intelligence on European political and military affairs, potentially gaining strategic advantages or undermining European security and alliances. Servers were primarily affected in Ukraine (30.9%), Georgia (13.6%), and Poland (12.3%)\nThis espionage attack uses spearphishing emails to deliver JavaScript payloads, exploiting the Roundcube vulnerability tracked as CVE-2023-563. Malicious code logs users out of Roundcube, presenting a new sign-in window. \nThe zero-day exploit allowed unauthorized access to mail servers across 80 organizations, including transport, education, chemical, and biological research sectors. The activity is similar to previous campaigns by other Russian-aligned threat groups like BlueDelta and Sandworm, which also targeted email solutions like Roundcube.\nThe compromised email servers pose a significant risk to Ukraine’s war effort, diplomatic relations, and coalition partners. Researchers warn that cyber-espionage groups targeting webmail software platforms, including Roundcube, may expose sensitive information about Ukraine’s defence efforts, partner countries, and third-party cooperation. They predict that these groups will continue targeting these platforms as Ukraine’s conflict continues and tensions with the EU and NATO rise.\nOrganizations must patch Roundcube installations, detect indicators of compromise (IoCs), and implement robust cybersecurity measures to mitigate the threat. Other effective security measures include strengthening email security, preferring encryption, secure email gateways, regular audits, employee awareness training, and network segmentation. The sophisticated attack methods and potential national security impact highlight the need for vigilance and awareness.\nChatGPT Down? Anonymous Sudan Claims Responsibility for DDoS Attacks\nAnonymous Sudan, a now prominent group of hacktivists, has claimed responsibility for targeting ChatGPT and its parent company, OpenAI, with a series of DDoS attacks.\nAnonymous Sudan also referenced alleged tweets attributed to Tal Broda, Head of Research Platform at OpenAI. The screenshots of these tweets depict Tal denying the existence of Palestine and criticizing calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.\nAccording to Anonymous Sudan, they plan to continue their DDoS attacks until OpenAI implements behavioural changes to ChatGPT to prevent the propagation of what they deem as “dehumanizing views of Palestinians.” Additionally, they demand the removal of Tal Broda from his position at OpenAI.\nOn the contrary, ChatGPT’s Status Page confirms service disruptions, including login issues. It also notes an “Elevated error rate impacting ChatGPT,” indicating a higher-than-usual number of errors occurring within the system or process. Such errors could arise from various factors, including faulty hardware, software bugs, network issues, DDoS attacks, or even human error.\nNevertheless, OpenAI is actively monitoring the situation and working to resolve the issue. However, as of now, there has been no official confirmation or acknowledgement from OpenAI regarding the company experiencing cyber attacks or the specific reasons behind the ChatGPT errors that users have been reporting since this afternoon.\nThis isn’t the first instance where Anonymous Sudan has claimed responsibility for DDoSing ChatGPT. Last November, the group made similar claims, and OpenAI acknowledged that its infrastructure was indeed targeted by DDoS attacks.\nFor expert commentary, we reached out to Oded Vanunu, Head of Product Vulnerability Research at Check Point Software. Vanunu linked Anonymous Sudan’s DDoS attacks to a strategy aimed at garnering media attention.\n“Russian-affiliated groups Anonymous Sudan and SkyNet have claimed responsibility for the latest outages on the OpenAI website and ChatGPT service. This is according to an ‘official spokesperson’ for Anonymous Sudan going by the name of Crush on Telegram,” said Oded. \n“Hacktivists often look for high-profile targets to disrupt in order to bring attention to themselves and in this case, Crush claims the groups attacked OpenAI due to the company’s perceived support of Israel.”\nAnonymous Sudan has been notably active in recent times. According to a recent report by Hackread.com, the group has conducted DDoS attacks on various targets, including the Israeli BAZAN Group and the United Arab Emirates-based FlyDubai Airline.\nFurthermore, the group targeted Thuraya Mobile Satellite Communications Company, an international mobile-satellite service (MSS) provider headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE). In both attacks on UAE-based infrastructure, Anonymous Sudan claimed that the UAE’s support for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) was evident through communication channels.\nIt’s worth noting that the RSF is a paramilitary force previously operated by the Government of Sudan and has been accused by hacktivists of committing war crimes against the Sudanese people.\nInfosys Data Breach Impacts 57,000 Bank of America Customers\nBank of America customers participating in deferred compensation plans are facing concerns after a data breach at Infosys McCamish Systems (IMS), a third-party provider managing these plans. The incident, initially reported in November 2023 but only publicly disclosed this month, exposed the personal information of 57,028 individuals.\nThe latest incident shouldn’t be surprising, given that Bank of America is a lucrative and highly sought-after target for both script kiddies and sophisticated cybercriminals. The data breach in May 2020 serves as a notable precedent, as does the continuing series of phishing attacks targeting the bank’s customers.\nIn a letter sent by Infosys McCamish to affected customers, on November 3rd, 2023, an unauthorized third party infiltrated the IMS systems, accessing sensitive customer data. The information potentially compromised includes names, addresses, social security numbers, dates of birth, financial details linked to deferred compensation plans and other account information.\nAccording to the data breach notification filed by the company with Maine’s Attorney General, 93 residents of Maine have been impacted by the data breach. The information trove could be used for a variety of malicious activities, including identity theft, financial fraud, and phishing scams. Although the specific nature of the security lapse remains unclear, IMS has implemented measures to prevent future breaches.\nWhile the exact number of affected Bank of America customers is known (57,028), the extent of data accessed for each individual remains uncertain. IMS claims they cannot determine which specific pieces of information were viewed by the unauthorized party.\nHowever, it is worth noting that on November 4, the LockBit ransomware gang claimed responsibility for the IMS attack, stating that its operators encrypted over 2,000 systems during the breach. \nBank of America learned of the breach on November 24th, 2023, and has since taken steps to notify affected customers. The bank is offering complimentary two-year memberships to Experian’s identity theft protection services to help mitigate potential risks. Additionally, they recommend that customers remain vigilant and monitor their accounts for suspicious activity.\nFor insights into the latest development, we spoke with Tim Callan, Chief Experience Officer at Sectigo, a Scottsdale, Arizona-based provider of comprehensive certificate lifecycle management (CLM), who raised questions about the cybersecurity measures at third parties.\n“As financial institutions increasingly rely on third-party vendors for various services, they inadvertently broaden their attack surface, exposing sensitive customer data to potential breaches. Strengthening oversight and implementing stringent security protocols for third-party partnerships are imperative to mitigate such risks,” Tim Advised.\nAl Lakhani, CEO of IDEE, emphasized the limitations of traditional multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems and advocated for next-generation MFA solutions to protect the supply chain.\n“Protecting the supply chain is critical. Especially when they can cause these kinds of attacks. Therefore, relying on first-generation MFA that requires two devices and lacks the capability to prevent credential phishing attacks is a non-starter,” Al explained. “To fortify supply chains effectively, they must be protected using next-generation MFA solutions, which protect against credential, phishing and password-based attacks, including adversary-in-the-middle attacks by using same device MFA,” he said.\nDespite Bank of America’s response, concerns remain for impacted individuals. The lack of clarity regarding which data was accessed and the possibility of misuse are significant sources of anxiety. The potential for financial losses, identity theft, and other negative consequences cannot be ignored.\nThis incident highlights the growing threat of data breaches within the financial services industry. It underscores the importance of strong cybersecurity measures for both financial institutions and third-party providers like IMS. The reliance on third-party services introduces additional vulnerabilities, requiring stringent data security protocols and comprehensive risk management strategies.\nWhile the immediate impact of the breach remains to be seen, it serves as a stark reminder of the importance of data privacy and security. Individuals are advised to remain vigilant, monitor their accounts closely, and utilize the resources offered by Bank of America. \nAdditionally, this incident emphasizes the need for stricter regulations and enhanced security protocols within the financial services industry to protect customer data and prevent future breaches.\nIvanti VPN Flaws Exploited by DSLog Backdoor and Crypto Miners\nOn January 31, 2024, Ivanti released fixes to address four vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-46805, CVE-2024-21887, CVE-2024-21888, and CVE-2024-21893. The last two vulnerabilities were disclosed the same day when the patch was released, along with a second set of mitigations as substitutes for the fixes. Within hours, Orange Cyberdefense CERT identified attacks targeting this vulnerability, allowing attackers to inject a backdoor into the Ivanti application.\nIn its report (PDF), Orange Cyberdefense noted discovering attackers exploiting the vulnerability to ensure persistent remote access. They injected a backdoor into a component using the SAML vulnerability, controlling access to the backdoor. Orange identified a compromised appliance on 3 February 2024, with initial mitigations applied but no patch. The attackers conducted reconnaissance to determine root access and deployed a new backdoor, DSLog, indicating they had root access to the device.\nA backdoor on a compromised device enables attackers to execute commands and log all web requests, including authenticated ones, and system logs. Orange identified 700 compromised appliances, with over a hundred compromised in attacks targeting CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887. The remaining ones had initial XML mitigation applied, preventing direct detection. The backdoor uses a unique hash per appliance.\nHackread has been following the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in Ivanti VPN devices. Hackers have exploited them to deploy KrustyLoader malware and cryptocurrency miners. For your information, CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 were found in Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) and Ivanti Policy Secure Gateway appliances.\nCVE-2023-46805, an Authentication Bypass flaw, allows remote attackers to bypass control checks, while CVE-2024-21887 is a Command Injection flaw that lets an authenticated administrator exploit Ivanti appliances by sending crafted requests and executing arbitrary commands. CVE-2024-21888 is a Privilege Escalation vulnerability in Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure, allowing a user to gain administrative privileges.\nCVE-2024-21893 is a server-side request forgery bug in the SAML component of Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and Neurons for ZTA. The issue could be exploited without authentication to leak sensitive information. In its latest advisory, Ivanti noted that a “limited” number of customers were affected by CVE-2024-21893. \nThe findings were also shared by Shadowserver Foundation, which reported in early February that a zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2024-21893, discovered by Ivanti in January 2024, is being exploited in the wild. Rapid7 reported a surge in attacks since February, with over 170 discrete IP addresses involved.\nOrganizations are advised to install Ivanti’s patches released on January 31 and February 1, which replace initial mitigations prevent zero-day exploitation, and factory reset their devices. Additionally, they should install security updates released on February 8 to address a vulnerability in the SAML component of VPN appliances, tracked as CVE-2024-22024.\nINC Ransomware Hits NHS Scotland, Threatens Leak of 3TB Patient Data\nThe INC ransomware gang has allegedly targeted the National Health Service in Scotland, commonly known as NHS Scotland. In a recent announcement on its dark web leak blog, the ransomware group claimed to have successfully stolen a whopping 3 terabytes of sensitive data. They have threatened to release this data if their demands are not met. \nAs seen by Hackread.com, the INC ransomware operators provided a “Proof pack” consisting of 14 screenshots. These screenshots appear to display patients’ records such as letters and email exchanges concerning their health, involving doctors and general practitioners (GPs) from various clinics and hospitals across the country.\nThe INC Ransomware gang, which emerged in July 2023, is a relatively new threat actor employing various tactics. They are notorious for encrypting a victim’s data and demanding a ransom payment for decryption. \nAdditionally, they engage in data theft, threatening to publicly leak the stolen information if the ransom isn’t paid. Recent reports indicate a focus on targeting healthcare institutions, intensifying the urgency to pay due to the sensitive nature of the stolen data, such as patient records.\nDespite emerging in July 2023, INC attacks have not been widely reported, indicating limited activity. However, they maintain a presence on the dark web, where they leak stolen victim data and possibly communicate ransom demands. \nThe recent claims of a ransomware attack on NHS Scotland have moved the group into the spotlight within the cybersecurity community, healthcare institutions, and mainstream media. Notably, this incident occurred shortly after NHS Dumfries and Galloway experienced a cyberattack, indicating a concerning trend within the healthcare sector.\nAt the time of writing, NHS Scotland has not confirmed the occurrence of the ransomware attack or whether it has experienced a data breach. However, if the institution does acknowledge the cyberattack, patients should prepare for potentially troubling news regarding the security of their information.\nCommenting on the news is Erfan Shadabi, a cybersecurity expert at comforte AG told Hackread.com, “The unfortunate cyberattack impacting NHS Scotland might make you question whether healthcare providers are serious about data privacy and security. This news should trigger alarm bells within the healthcare sector. After all, it is difficult to grasp a situation in which 3TB of the most personal and sensitive health information is being stolen.”\n“When ransomware attacks hit healthcare institutions, we in data-heavy industries should all take a pause and consider the implications of our cybersecurity choices. The enterprise surely pays a steep price for non-compliance, lax data security measures, and failure to prevent attacks and subsequent data leaks caused by phishing, ransomware, and a host of other attack vectors. However, let’s not lose sight of the end victim, which is the individual whose private and sensitive health data wrongfully becomes public,” Erfan warned.\nHe advised that “The best way to prevent the pain suffered by the victims is to safeguard sensitive records such as medical information through a data-centric approach to data protection. Data-centric methods such as tokenization replace sensitive data elements with innocuous tokens that maintain the analytic value of the data while obscuring the actual sensitive information itself. It becomes non-identifying and therefore worthless in the hands of threat actors while remaining fully workable by the enterprise. Implementing strong data-centric security is the right prescription for every enterprise.” \nRansomware Attack Disrupts Services in 18 Romanian Hospitals\nRomanian authorities have reported a devastating ransomware attack on multiple medical facilities using the Hipocrate Information System (HIS) healthcare management system. The system became non-functional, making hospital staff unable to access files\/databases and forcing patients to wait in emergency rooms. For your information, hospitals use this system to manage medical activities and patient data.\nThe Romanian Ministry of Health confirmed that the system is down at the impacted hospitals and that their file\/databases are encrypted. The ministry advises hospitals to focus on restoring IT services and data and urges users to not reach out to IT staff to help them focus on restoration job. Hospitals are working with the National Cybersecurity Center to identify and address the issues, Health Minister Alexandru Rafila stated.\nRafila initially claimed that 15-20 hospitals in Romania and Bucharest could be facing operational difficulties due to the attack, which took place on production servers running HIS IT system. It started on the night of 11-12 February. As per the latest update, at least 18 medical facilities have been affected in this attack. Some hospitals’ websites, including Fundeni Clinical Institute or Military Emergency Hospital “Dr. Alexandru Gafencu” Constanta are unreachable.\nRomania’s National Cyber Security Directorate (NCSD) has dispatched specialists to investigate the incident. The identity of the attacker and the theft of patients’ data remain unclear.\n“We don’t have the information, but we are working together with the National Cybersecurity Center to elucidate the causes and remedy them,” the minister said.\nThe list of the eighteen impacted hospitals shared by Romanian-Insider includes the following:\nHospitals and medical facilities’ IT infrastructure are vulnerable targets for hackers. Hackread has observed that threat actors generally exploit five pressure points: shutdown of medical appliances, loss of patient medical history, public backlash, and potential federal and criminal investigations.\nIn September 2020, German hospital named University Hospital Düsseldorf (UKD) suffer a reported ransomware attack which led to the death of a patient. In August 2023, cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler discovered a massive data leak at Cigna Health, a major health insurance company. The database, containing over 17 billion records, mainly contained healthcare provider information and negotiated medical procedure rates.\nThen in November 2023, SafetyDetectives cybersecurity researchers reported a data breach involving over 2 million Turkish citizens’ vaccination data from 2015 to 2023. The data was likely extracted using an information disclosure vulnerability.\nIn January 2024, Hackread reported the ALPHV ransomware gang’s targeted attack on Transformative Healthcare, occurring in late April 2023. Attackers stole a terabyte of data, including medical and paramedic reports, exposing data of nearly 1 million people, including 20,486 Maine residents. The attacker accessed a server containing patient information, which Transformative claimed was stored to comply with legal obligations.\nThese incidents indicate how vulnerable hospitals’ data management systems could be. To protect patient data, hospitals should consider implementing better security controls. Hackers can make quick cash from selling Personal Health Information (PHI), which is worth more than PII.\nQR Code Scam: Fake Voicemails Target Users, 1000 Attacks in 14 Days\nResearchers at Check Point Harmony Email have discovered a surge in cyberattacks involving fake voicemails. According to the company’s report shared with Hackread.com, cybercriminals are exploiting corporate phone systems’ links to email servers, embedding malicious links in voicemail playbacks for credential harvesting.\nScammers are increasingly using voicemail as a lure to trick users into clicking on malicious links one of which is creating legitimate-looking voicemails. Since corporate phone systems are tied to email, scammers are using this to include a voicemail recording hyperlinked to a malicious page. In this case, 1,000 attacks have been reported during the last two weeks.\nWhat happens in this attack is that through social engineering, scammers send QR codes with conditional routing based on the device, targeting any end-user. The email analyzed by Check Point researchers appeared to be sent by payment processor service Square. However, in reality, the name was only used to mislead users. \nMoreover, the email’s subject line contained a phone number, which was illegitimate when searched on Google. The email also includes an embedded MP3 player, containing the voicemail. It redirects users to a credential harvesting page when clicked.\nThis attack relies on user participation. Any successful phishing attack requires user input, except for zero-click attacks. Users must replay, click on links, or enter information for the attack to progress. This allows scammers to experiment with creative options, such as impersonating a reputable brand and using voicemails. They observe user behaviour and adjust their attacks accordingly, ensuring a successful phishing attack.\nHackread has been reporting a rise in the trend of combining voice and phishing, aka Vishing to trap unsuspecting users into giving away sensitive data. We earlier reported Check Point researchers identifying a vishing campaign targeting users in South Korea with a new Android malware, dubbed “FakeCalls.” Cybercriminals tricked users into sharing sensitive financial information through fake calls supposedly made by legitimate financial organizations. This is part of a growing global threat to mobile banking customers, using sophisticated social engineering techniques to make calls seem legitimate.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, email security firm IronScales discovered around 100,000 new phishing campaigns targeting companies using PBX telephone systems for communication and information sharing. These scams, targeting working-from-home employees from various sectors like engineering, real estate, IT, oil & gas, healthcare, financial services, and IT, involved voicemail email phishing.\nVishing, or voice phishing, involves using telephones to trick users into disclosing financial and personal information, such as account numbers and passwords. Fraudsters may claim compromised accounts, represent banks or law enforcement, or offer software installation assistance. Protecting yourself involves knowledge, hanging up if asked for personal information, and calling a reliable source. Security professionals can implement AI-based security, check and emulate all URLs, and use multiple layers of protection.\nData Breach Affects 66,000 in SIM-Swapping Attacks on US Insurance Giants\nA recent notification has revealed data breaches at insurance giants Washington National Insurance Company and Bankers Life and Casualty Company, both of which are subsidiaries of the CNO Financial Group. The breaches, originating from SIM-swapping attacks, occurred in November 2023 and have since sparked widespread concerns about data security.\nFor your information, SIM-swapping attacks involve fraudulently obtaining control of a victim’s mobile phone number by convincing the victim’s mobile carrier to switch the SIM card linked to the number to one in the possession of the attacker. \nOnce the attacker gains control of the victim’s phone number, they can intercept incoming calls and text messages, allowing them to bypass security measures such as two-factor authentication (2FA) that rely on codes sent via SMS. \nThis enables the attacker to access sensitive accounts, such as banking or cryptocurrency wallets, and carry out fraudulent transactions or steal personal information. SIM-swapping attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the verification processes of mobile carriers and can have severe consequences for victims, including financial loss and identity theft.\nWashington National Insurance Company is reaching out to 20,360 individuals affected by the breach, whereas Bankers Life and Casualty Company is contacting 45,842 individuals. The compromised data potentially contains customers’ names, Social Security Numbers, dates of birth, and customer account numbers.\nAccording to the data breach notification filed with the Office of the Attorney General of California on January 26, 2024, Bankers Life promptly initiated an investigation to assess the extent of the compromise. Thereafter, the company began the process of notifying affected individuals through data breach notification letters, outlining the breach’s implications and offering guidance on protective measures.\nReceiving a notification letter from Bankers Life and Casualty Company emphasises the urgency for affected individuals to understand the risks posed and take appropriate actions to safeguard their information. Failure to uphold data protection obligations can render companies liable, opening the possibility for legal recourse through data breach lawsuits.\nFor insights, we reached out to Rebecca Moody, Head of Data Research at Comparitech, who emphasized that SIM-swapping attacks involve more than just identity theft or taking over someone else’s SIM card; they can also be used to carry out ransomware attacks.\n“For example, Advarra’s ransomware attack in October 2023 was carried out after one of its executives was the victim of a SIM swap. ALPHV\/BlackCat claimed the attack and said it had stolen 120GB+ of data. This included sensitive data belonging to employees, patients, and customers,“ Rebecca said while discussing potential consequences.\nRebecca also emphasized the specifics of the data breach notification (PDF), indicating that threat actors conducted SIM-swapping without proper authorization or verification. “The data breach notifications suggest the attacks were enabled as “a retailer for one of the top nationwide wireless carriers, without proper authorisation or appropriate verification from the senior officer, allowed the senior officer’s phone number to be swapped to what we believe was the threat actor’s phone,“ Rebecca explained.\nRebecca cautioned and advised users that “to prevent SIM-swapping attacks, users should use secure authentication apps instead of their phone number for two-factor authentication, add additional layers of security to their mobile phone number accounts (e.g. pin codes and security questions), avoid linking accounts to their phone number, and be generally wary of any requests for personal data.“\nThe FBI is aware of the issue. The root cause of the breach is yet to be fully elucidated, with ongoing investigations expected to shed more light on the matter. However, initial reports suggest that the incident may have originated from a cyberattack targeting one of Bankers Life’s vendors, emphasising the substantial risks associated with third-party breaches.\nVictims of the breach are advised to remain alert against potential fraudulent activities, such as identity theft. As investigations continue, affected individuals can expect further updates on the breach and its implications.\nThe breach at Bankers Life and Casualty Company highlights the ongoing importance of addressing challenges in data security, emphasizing the need for businesses and consumers to prioritize strong cybersecurity measures to reduce risks and protect sensitive information.\nChained Exploits, Stolen VPN Access: Hackers Target Ivanti Users Despite Patches\nThe Shadowserver Foundation reports that a zero-day vulnerability, CVE-2024-21893 (CVSS score 8.2), disclosed by Ivanti on 31 January 2024, is now being actively exploited in the wild. Rapid7 noted a surge in attacks exploiting CVE-2024-21893 since February 2, before they released a proof-of-concept exploit for the issue. \nThe non-profit claims to have seen over 170 discrete IP addresses involved in attempted attacks. The flaw is in the SAML component of Ivanti Connect Secure, Ivanti Policy Secure, and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA, allowing attackers to access restricted resources without authentication.\nFor your information, Hackread reported last month that VPN appliances had multiple zero-day vulnerabilities, allowing remote attackers to execute commands and even load a Rust-based malware called KrustyLoader. Two of the vulnerabilities tracked CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887, impacted all supported versions of Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure gateways. \nThe latest reports suggest a total of four vulnerabilities impacting Ivanti products. This analysis is based on the report that Ivanti has released patches for four vulnerabilities. The fourth one is tracked as CVE-2024-21888. The company also released a second mitigation to help organizations build resilience against attacks chaining CVE-2024-21893 with CVE-2024-21887 to compromise Ivanti devices.\nHowever, Rapid7 principal security researcher Stephen Fewer posted on X that CVE-2024-21893 is not a new vulnerability, but an already discovered n-day in the xmltooling library tracked as CVE-2023-36661 and patched out in June 2023. \nAttacks exploiting Ivanti zero-days have been rising rapidly since their disclosure. In late January threat intelligence firm Volexity reported a surge in attacks exploiting two Ivanti zero-days, particularly by a group UTA0178, linked to China. At least 20 organizations using Ivanti Connect Secure VPN appliances were compromised, with Volexity confirming that the number of compromised systems to likely higher than what was discovered.\nReportedly, UTA0178 was exploiting CVE-2024-21893 to bypass Ivanti’s initial mitigation for two zero days. The hackers were using CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 in a chain to compromise Ivanti Connect Secure VPN and Policy Secure network access control.\nNew ResumeLooters Gang Targets Job Seekers, Steals Millions of Resumes\nIn November 2023, Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence unit discovered a malicious campaign that targeted APAC (Asia Pacific region) employment agencies and retail companies. GroupIB dubbed the hackers behind the campaign as ResumeLooters.\nOverall, 65 websites were targeted, using SQL injection attacks and injecting cross-site scripting (XSS) scripts, to steal sensitive user databases storing sensitive information like names, phone numbers, emails, and employment history. The stolen data was then sold on Telegram channels.\nGroup-IB researchers discovered Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) infection on genuine job search websites, aiming to load malicious scripts and display phishing forms. The earliest attacks date back to early 2023, as per the file creation dates detected on the attackers’ servers.\nThe hackers stole more than two million unique email addresses, targeting users in India, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. SQLi attacks targeted back-end user databases, while XSS techniques were used to display phishing content on sites and visitors’ devices.\nGroup-IB has identified ResumeLooters as the second group conducting SQL injection attacks against companies in the Asia-Pacific region, following GambleForce, which has carried out over 20 attacks so far. \nThe latter group typically targets India, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, since over 70% of its known victims were located in the region. Researchers also identified compromised entities in Brazil, the USA, Turkey, Russia, Mexico, Italy, and other non-APAC countries.\nIt is worth noting that Group-IB had recently unmasked EagleStrike, a subgroup of the GambleForce hacker group, who exploited simple vulnerabilities. The group targeted 24 organizations across 8 countries, compromising websites in Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, China, India, and Thailand between September and December 2023.\nAccording to the company’s blog post, ResumeLooters uses various penetration testing tools, including sqlmap, Acunetix, Beef Framework, X-Ray, Metasploit, ARL, and Dirsearch. Their main vector was SQL injection via sqlmap. \nAnalysis of stolen HTML files shows the malicious script was executed on at least four websites with some having XSS scripts embedded in the HTML code mainly on devices having administrative access. The attackers’ accounts and advertisements for data sale were discovered in hacking-themed Telegram groups having Chinese-speaking members.\nThe report highlights the vulnerability of SQLi and XSS attacks on websites, underscoring the need for businesses to implement best practices like web application firewalls and input validation. It also highlights the potential damage caused by these attacks, which are “fueled by poor security and inadequate database and website management” Group-IB researchers concluded.\nThere have been several surprising breaches involving the exposure of employee or job seekers’ data. In July 2022, a North Korean-backed Lazarus group of hackers, posing as IT freelancers, used a fake job offer to infiltrate Sky Mavis’ network.\nMore recently, in January 2023, Hackread reported independent security researcher Anurag Sen discovered a misconfigured server belonging to an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Software provider in California. \nThe Elasticsearch server exposed the personal data of over half a million Indian job seekers, as well as the company’s employees and client records from companies like Apple and Samsung. The server had been publicly accessible without any security authentication or password since late December 2022.\nAnyDesk Urges Password Change Amid Security Breach\nAnyDesk, a remote desktop software maker, has reportedly become a victim of a cyberattack that compromised its production systems, allegedly allowing hackers to access source code and private code signing keys. \nIt is worth noting that the company experienced a four-day outage from January 29th to February 1st 2024, affecting the users’ ability to log in to the AnyDesk client.\nIn its official advisory, Germany-based AnyDesk revealed discovering the attack after detecting signs of intrusion on its product servers. After a security audit, they activated a response plan in collaboration with CrowdStrike.\nMedia reports suggest that the attackers stole source code and code signing certificates; however, AnyDesk has not confirmed it yet. It has only confirmed that the incident was not a ransomware attack. \nAnyDesk responded to the incident by revoking all security-related certificates and systems replacing or remediating its systems. It also plans to revoke the previous code signing certificate for binaries with a new one. \nMoreover, the company has revoked all passwords for its web portal (my.anydeskcom) too, as a precautionary measure. Relevant authorities have been notified of the breach as well.\nAlthough AnyDesk states there is no evidence of any end-user systems affected it did not share the details on how the production system hacking occurred or regarding stealing of information and session hijacking. The company noted that it never stores private keys, security tokens, or passwords so end-users should not feel threatened by the breach.\n“Our systems are designed not to store private keys, security tokens or passwords that could be exploited to connect to end-user devices. As a precaution, we are revoking all passwords to our web portal, my.anydesk.com, and we recommend that users change their passwords if the same credentials are used elsewhere,” AnyDesk’s advisory read.\nNevertheless, AnyDesk is urging users to change their passwords if reused on other online services and download the latest version AnyDesk 8.0.8, which has a new code signing certificate. It is still surprising because certificates are invalidated only when they have been compromised.\nAnyDesk is a popular remote access solution for enterprise users, with over 170,000 customers including high-profile firms like Amedes, AutoForm Engineering, LG Electronics, Comcast, NVIDIA, 7-Eleven, Siemens, MIT, Samsung Electronics, Spidercam, Thales, and the United Nations. \nUnfortunately, its wide reach and remote accessibility make it a popular tool among threat actors for gaining persistent access to breached devices and networks. In July 2021, Hackread reported seizing a fake call centre that had been scamming US citizens for seven months with employees posing as Amazon’s technical support team. The employees extorted Amazon users by claiming their Amazon IDs were hacked and tricked them into paying for fake ID repairs via the AnyDesk app.\nSchneider Electric Energy Giant Confirms Cactus Ransomware Attack\nSchneider Electric, a global leader in energy management and automation, has suffered a ransomware attack that impacted its Sustainability Business division. The attack, which occurred on January 17, 2024, involved the deployment of the Cactus ransomware, a strain known for targeting industrial organizations.\nThe attack primarily affected Schneider Electric’s EcoStruxure Resource Advisor platform, used by over 2,000 companies worldwide to monitor energy and resource data. While the full extent of the breach is still under investigation, it is confirmed that some data was accessed by the attackers. Fortunately, no other Schneider Electric divisions or business units were affected.\nAccording to a press release, the company immediately launched a global incident response, mobilizing its internal team and bringing in external cybersecurity experts to contain the attack and restore affected systems. Additionally, Schneider Electric is notifying customers who may have been impacted by the breach.\nAs of January 31, 2024, Schneider Electric is still working to restore full functionality to its systems. Most systems are expected to be back online within the next few days. However, the attack could potentially disrupt operations for some of Schneider Electric’s customers, and there is a risk that customer data may have been compromised.\nCybersecurity experts have expressed concern about the growing trend of ransomware attacks targeting industrial organizations. They warn that such attacks can have significant consequences, disrupting critical infrastructure and potentially endangering public safety.\nJohn Gallagher, Vice President of Viakoo Labs at Viakoo said “Whether for IoT, OT, or ICS systems it has been a long-standing best practice to ensure these systems are on dedicated and isolated networks to prevent lateral movement if vulnerable IoT devices are breached. But this is not that situation; this is a business division and more like a fully separate company.”\nJohn advised that “In addition to isolated or segmented networks, effective use of zero trust principles can also be effective in preventing lateral movement within an organization.”\n“Using application-based discovery to identify all application, device, and port relationships can also be effective in setting up and maintaining an isolated network. Too often a network is properly configured and isolated, but over time both users and configuration drift can impact that segmentation and allow punch-throughs,” he added.\nUkraine Claims Destruction of 280 Russian Servers, 2 Petabytes Lost\nCybersecurity specialists from the Ukrainian HUR (Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine) have claimed a successful cyber attack on IPL Consulting. They reportedly destroyed its entire IT infrastructure, resulting in communication outages across the country.\nFor your information, IPL Consulting is a Russian company that implements information systems in the local industry. As per HUR’s announcement on Facebook, the company is among the most advanced of all Russian enterprises facilitating information system implementation services to institutions in the automotive, aviation, heavy engineering, and defense sectors. Ukrainian intelligence reports that HUR specialists targeted dozens of its servers and databases.\nIPL Consulting’s internal network was breached by hackers, resulting in the deletion of over 60 terabytes of data and the destruction of dozens of servers and databases. The full cost of damages remains unclear. According to HUR, the damage is particularly significant amidst ongoing sanctions pressure and affects numerous Russian companies operating in the defence sector.\nCyberattacks have become a common tool in the Russia-Ukraine war, with a devastating attack on telecom firm Kyivstar on December 12, 2023, resulting in widespread communication outages. The Russian hacker group Solntsepek, linked to Russia’s military intelligence agency, claimed responsibility for this attack. Ukrainian cyber specialists have also been quite aggressive on the digital front lately.\nIn a separate attack, a Ukrainian hacking group “Blackjack” infiltrated Russia’s Main Military Construction Directorate for Special Projects, downloading 1.2 TB of data, including technical documentation for over 500 military sites, confirmed HUR on its Telegram channel on January 19, 2024. The group also transmitted critical intelligence about Russian facilities to Ukrainian armed forces. The hackers temporarily disrupted the company’s operations. \nAnother cyberattack was launched against the Russian Far Eastern Research Center of Space Hydrometeorology “Planeta” in Khabarovsk on January 24, 2024, resulting in the destruction of 280 servers and the loss of 2 petabytes (2 million gigabytes) of data, valued at least $10 million. This attack is attributed to Volunteer Patriots from the BO Team group. Planeta is responsible for receiving\/processing military satellite data.\nAccording to HUR’s claim, hackers also managed to destroy weather and satellite data for various Russian agencies, including the Russian Ministry of Emergency Affairs, the Ministry of Defense, and Roscosmos. HUR states that the over $350,000 supercomputer cannot be restored, and given the Western sanctions on Russia, the country cannot obtain this software.\nMoreover, they disrupted air conditioning, humidification systems, and emergency power supply regulations. The HUR also stated that the attack disconnected a Russian station in the Arctic, affecting strategic companies vital to defence and supporting Russian occupation forces. \nThe incident follows a previous incident in which the HUR collected 100 gigabytes of confidential, intelligence data valued at $1.5 billion, and belonging to Special Technology Center LLC, operating in Russia’s military-industrial complex.\nJason’s Deli Data Breach Exposes 344,000 Users in Credential Stuffing Attack\nPopular American fast-casual restaurant chain Jason’s Deli has been hit by a data breach, exposing the personal information of millions of customers. The incident, a credential stuffing attack, occurred in December 2023 and affected approximately 344,000 users.\nIt is worth noting that hackers employed the same attack technique during the 23andME data breach, a DNA testing service. The company, however, shifted the blame onto the victims, loosely arguing that the breach could have been prevented if the affected individuals had not used the same password on other accounts.\nAs per the data breach notification filed by the company with Maine’s attorney general office, the incident was identified and took place on 21 December 2023. During the attack, hackers gained unauthorized access to Deli Dollar and online account login credentials of approximately 344,000 users. \nThe attackers used a technique known as credential stuffing, which involves taking usernames and passwords stolen from other data breaches and trying them on different websites. \nWhen it comes to login credentials, hackers were able to access customers’ usernames and passwords. Other potentially exposed data includes the following: \nHowever, the company maintains that the attackers would likely have had limited access, unable to view your complete payment or gift card number—possibly only the last four digits.\nJason’s Deli has apologized for the data breach and assured customers that they are taking steps to improve their cybersecurity. The company has stated that they are conducting a review of its security protocols and implementing additional safeguards to prevent future attacks.\nFor insights into the data breach, we reached out to Lionel Litty, Chief Security Architect at Menlo Security who emphasised that companies must implement Multi-Factor Authentication on customers’ accounts.\n“While Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is crucial for password reuse and credential stuffing, not all MFA solutions offer equal protection but to truly get the full value from MFA and ensure comprehensive protection, organizations must invest in phishing-resistant MFA,” Litty explained. \n“By doing so, they not only mitigate the risks associated with password compromise but also elevate their overall cybersecurity posture. Remember, the technology you use matters and will produce better outcomes,” he said.\nThe data breaches at Jason’s Deli have raised concerns about the security of customer information and the potential for identity theft. Customers whose information was exposed in the credential stuffing attack are at risk of having their online accounts hacked.\nJason’s Deli has advised customers to monitor their financial statements for any unauthorized activity and to report any suspicious charges to their bank or credit card company. The company has also provided information on how to protect themselves from identity theft.\nIf you are a Jason’s Deli customer, it is important to take steps to protect your personal information. Here are a few recommendations:\nThe data breaches at Jason’s Deli serve as a reminder of the importance of protecting our personal information. By taking steps to be more vigilant and security-conscious, we can help reduce the risk of becoming a victim of identity theft or other cybercrime.\nLockBit Ransomware Gang Claims Subway as New Victim\nInternational fast-food restaurant chain Subway is facing a potential PR nightmare due to an alleged ransomware attack carried out by the notorious LockBit ransomware gang. Reports suggest Subway’s systems were compromised by the LockBit gang, known for its aggressive tactics.\nSubway has launched an investigation after the LockBit ransomware group claimed to have hacked the company’s SUBS internal systems and stole a trove of data. The ransomware-as-a-service provider added the company to its data leak site, stating that one of its affiliates stole gigabytes of sensitive data.\nLockBit stated that they are giving some time for the group to protect the data “which includes hundreds of gigabytes of data and all financial  of the franchise, including employee salaries, franchise royalty payments, master franchise commission payments, restaurant turnovers, etc.” If they do not, the group will sell it to competitors. The company has added the company to its data leak site.\nThe message was posted on January 21, and the attackers have given Subway time until February 2 to pay a ransom. However, Subway’s spokesperson claims the company is still validating the hackers’ claims.\nFor your information, LockBit is one of the most active ransomware groups, victimizing thousands of organizations. In June 2023, the US government reported that the LockBit gang has targeted 1,700 entities in the US since 2020, making over $90 million in ransom payments.\nWhat’s surprising for many in this incident is that Subway was unaware of the ransomware attack. However, this isn’t strange because, lately, hackers are skipping the ransomware attacks’ encryption part and focusing on stealing data since designing, developing, maintaining, and deploying ransomware has become too difficult. Companies have substantially improved their data backup and defence; therefore, threat actors steal data and demand payment for not disclosing it publicly.\nIt is worth noting that Subway has 20,000 locations worldwide and over 400,000 employees, so the data leak could have lasting implications for its customers if it happened. To protect yourself from online threats, be cautious when clicking links or opening attachments, use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, keep software and operating systems updated, and invest in reputable antivirus and anti-malware software. Practice good cyber hygiene for the best defence against cybercrime.\nChinese APTs Targeted ASEAN During Summit with Espionage Malware\nA recent report by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 cybersecurity research team has revealed a coordinated cyber espionage campaign that targeted countries affiliated with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The Chinese Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups are blamed for this.\nThe report, titled “ASEAN Entities in the Spotlight: Chinese APT Group Targeting,” highlights the activities of two separate APT groups. One identified group is Stately Taurus, a well-known threat actor with a history of cyberespionage operations.\nUnit 42 researchers discovered that the cyber attack involved two malicious packages including “Talking_Points_for_China.zip,” a ZIP file and “PSO.scr,” an executable screensaver file. One of these malware packages was created by Stately Taurus specifically matching with the dates of the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit held in March 2024 in Melbourne. \nThis suggests a targeted effort to gather intelligence during the critical regional event. This incident is also similar to the one in July 2023, where pro-Ukraine attendees of the NATO Summit were targeted with the RomCom RAT malware. Russian government hackers were suspected in that case.\n“These types of campaigns continue to demonstrate how organizations are targeted for cyber espionage purposes, where nation-state affiliated threat groups collect intelligence of geopolitical interests within the region”\nThe report goes on to show why organizations within ASEAN countries must take strong measures to defend against such cyberattacks. Palo Alto Networks recommends deploying advanced security solutions like DNS Security, Advanced URL Filtering, and WildFire to mitigate these threats.\nWhile the Unit 42 report identifies two specific APT groups, the full extent of the campaign and the potential involvement of other actors remain under investigation. Continued monitoring and threat intelligence gathering are essential to fully understand the scope of this espionage activity.\nNevertheless, this discovery comes amidst heightened geopolitical tensions in the Southeast Asian region. The targeted nature of the attacks, coinciding with a major regional summit, raises concerns about potential attempts to gain an advantage in international relations.\nCybersecurity experts are urging ASEAN member states and affiliated organizations to remain alert against such cyberespionage efforts. Collaboration on information sharing and implementing proper cybersecurity measures is a must to defend against these ongoing threats.\nTeamViewer Exploited to Obtain Remote Access, Deploy Ransomware\nTeamViewer has a history of being exploited in large-scale cyber attacks. Recently, once again, cybersecurity experts have observed a surprising surge in cybercriminals’ attempts to exploit TeamViewer, a trusted remote access tool, to deploy LockBit ransomware, potentially exposing users to data encryption and extortion demands.\nResearchers claim attackers exploit vulnerabilities in TeamViewer to gain initial access to victim devices and then deploy the aggressive LockBit ransomware, which encrypts critical files and demands substantial ransom payments for decryption. \nAlthough infections were either contained or averted, no ransomware operation has been officially associated with the intrusions. The payload resembled LockBit ransomware encryptors. It is worth noting that in 2022, the ransomware builder for LockBit 3.0 was leaked, allowing the Bl00dy and Buhti gangs to launch their campaigns.\nFor your information, TeamViewer is a popular remote access tool in the enterprise world. Unfortunately, it has been exploited by scammers and ransomware actors to access remote desktops and execute malicious files for years. In March 2016, numerous victims reported their devices being breached via TeamViewer and attempts made to encrypt files with the Surprise ransomware.\nBack then, TeamViewer’s unauthorized access was attributed to credential stuffing, where attackers used users’ leaked credentials instead of exploiting a zero-day vulnerability.\nThe software vendor explained that online criminals often log on with compromised accounts to find corresponding accounts with the same credentials, potentially allowing them to access all assigned devices for malware or ransomware installation.\nThe latest analysis from Huntress SOC analysts reveals that cybercriminals continue to use old techniques, abusing TeamViewer to take over devices and deploy ransomware. In one of the instances, as observed by Huntress, a single threat actor used TeamViewer to compromise two endpoints by deploying a DOS batch file on the desktop, and executing a DLL payload.\nIn both cases, Huntress researchers observed similarities, hinting that a common attacker could be responsible. Huntress observed multiple employee accesses to the first compromised endpoint, indicating that it was used for legitimate administrative tasks. The second endpoint, running since 2018, had no activity in logs for three months, indicating that it is less monitored and potentially more attractive to attackers.\n“An investigation into each endpoint illustrated that initial access to each endpoint was achieved via TeamViewer. The final entry from the TeamViewer connections_incoming.txt log file showed the threat actor’s access to each endpoint.”\nTeamViewer attributes unauthorized access cases to issues in the tool’s default security settings. The attacks appear to be using the password-protected LockBit 3 DLL. However, Bleeping Computer identified a different sample uploaded to VirusTotal that was detected as LockBit Black but it wasn’t using the standard LockBit 3.0 ransomware note, suggesting another ransomware gang’s involvement in creating the builder.\nReports suggest attackers have not launched a widespread campaign yet, which means there is potential for expansion. To protect yourself, update TeamViewer software, enable two-factor authentication, be wary of suspicious connections, and invest in vital cybersecurity solutions like antivirus, anti-malware, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to detect and prevent potential threats.\nFor insight into the latest development, we reached out to Xage Security’s CEO Geoffrey Mattson who shared the following statement regarding the exploitation of TeamViewer:\n“This attack underscores a growing trend in cyber threats, wherein cyber adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in legacy security and virtualization software and steer away from traditional targets like browsers and endpoints. Notably, VPNs, Firewalls, VDIs, and Remote Access Tools have become prime vectors for multi-stage attacks, prompting the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue new advisories, such as “Protecting Against Malicious Use of Remote Monitoring and Management Software.”\n“The vulnerability is compounded by another challenge – TeamViewer is often installed as “shadow IT” by employees looking for easier access solutions than the official option at their company,” said Geoffrey. “That means the security and IT teams may not even know about the existence of TeamViewer in their environment, and thus won’t know that they’re exposed to this attack vector. The complexity of existing enterprise remote access solutions leads employees to create security risks. Ease-of-use is a security issue,” he warned.\nMicrosoft Executives’ Emails Breached by Russia Hackers\nIn a concerning turn of events, Microsoft disclosed on Friday that a Russia-linked hacking group known as Nobelium gained access to the email accounts of several top executives, including members of the company’s senior leadership team. The attack, detected last week, raises concerns about potential espionage and the vulnerability of critical infrastructure.\nNobelium, also known as Midnight Blizzard, is a cybercriminal group notorious for its involvement in the December 2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack, which compromised numerous government agencies and private companies. \nIn the latest incident, the hackers exploited a compromised “legacy” test account to gain a foothold within Microsoft’s corporate network. They then leveraged the compromised account’s permissions to access a small portion of employee email accounts, including those belonging to senior executives, cybersecurity personnel, legal staff, and others.\nWhile the full extent of the breach is still under investigation, Microsoft maintains that the attack did not involve vulnerabilities in their core products or services. Additionally, they assured customers that no customer data was compromised. \nHowever, the potential consequences remain worrying. The accessed emails could contain sensitive information related to company strategies, intellectual property, and even government contracts.\n“We are still investigating the incident and its full scope,” Microsoft stated in a blog post published on January 19, 2024. “We are working with law enforcement to understand the threat actors’ motives and take appropriate action. We are also taking steps to strengthen our security posture further and prevent similar attacks in the future.”\nIn a regulatory filing on January 17, 2024, Microsoft provided additional details of the cyber attack, stating the following:\nThis incident highlights the growing threat posed by state-sponsored cyberattacks. Experts warn that such attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and targeted, highlighting the need for robust cybersecurity measures across all sectors. Governments and businesses must prioritize investments in cybersecurity infrastructure and personnel to mitigate these risks.\nThe Microsoft email breach serves as a wake-up call for corporations and governments worldwide. As cyberattacks become more prevalent and sophisticated, cybersecurity must become a top priority. Continued vigilance, collaboration between stakeholders, and investment in advanced security solutions are crucial to building resilience against these evolving threats.\nThis developing story will likely continue to unfold in the coming days and weeks as more details about the attack emerge. We will keep you updated on any significant developments.\nAnonymous Sudan’s DDoS Attacks Disrupt Network at Israeli BAZAN Group\nAnonymous Sudan, the pro-Palestinian hacktivist group, has taken credit for a series of Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS attacks) on BAZAN Group, Israel’s top oil refinery operator. This recent claim closely follows their announcement of targeting the London Internet Exchange (LINX) in protest against the Yemen strikes.\nOn Wednesday evening, January 17, the DDoS attacks began with notable intensity, causing extensive disruptions in the network of BAZAN Group’s critical infrastructure. The scale of the impact was confirmed by NetBlocks, a global internet monitoring platform specializing in tracking outages, disruptions, and censorship events worldwide.\nOn Wednesday, NetBlocks officially reported a significant network disruption affecting Bazan Group through its official X account on Twitter. Simultaneously, Anonymous Sudan took to its Telegram channel to announce and claim responsibility for the orchestrated attack.\n    Confirmed: Live metrics show a major disruption to the network of Bazan Group \/ Oil Refineries Ltd petrochemical company in #Israel; prolific hacktivist group Anonymous Sudan has claimed a cyberattack on the company, which operates the country’s largest oil refinery    pic.twitter.com\/SUKmiI45t1— NetBlocks (@netblocks) January 17, 2024 \n\n   Confirmed: Live metrics show a major disruption to the network of Bazan Group \/ Oil Refineries Ltd petrochemical company in #Israel; prolific hacktivist group Anonymous Sudan has claimed a cyberattack on the company, which operates the country’s largest oil refinery   pic.twitter.com\/SUKmiI45t1\n“We have conducted a huge cyber attack on the digital infrastructure of one of the biggest oil refining and petrochemicals companies in Israel,” the group said. The statement was followed by additional details of what was hit and what remained untouched.\n“Their entire infrastructure has been hit hard. Note; some irrelevant public-facing BAZAN websites may be up; however, the important infrastructure servers are confirmed to be down,” the group claimed.\nThe hacktivist group stated that the motive behind targeting the BAZAN Group was in direct response to Israeli aggression against Palestinians. The group mentioned that the DDoS attacks were a form of protest, stating that “Attacks against Israel will continue as they continue their genocidal campaign on Gaza.” The group claimed responsibility for any damage to the overall health of BAZAN Group and any collateral damage resulting from the DDoS attacks.\nThis incident is not the first time Bazan Group has faced DDoS attacks. In July 2023, another pro-Palestinian group named Cyber Avengers claimed responsibility for an attack on the company. Consequently, the group’s websites were taken offline and restricted to users outside Israel.\nIt is worth noting that on January 16, 2023, Anonymous Sudan also claimed responsibility for targeting Thuraya Mobile Satellite Communications Company, an international mobile-satellite service (MSS) provider based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nAnonymous Sudan revealed that their targeting of Thuraya was motivated by the belief that the company’s satellites are utilized by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for communication. Notably, RSF is a paramilitary force formerly operated by the Government of Sudan, accused by the hacktivists of committing war crimes against the Sudanese people.\nThe recent series of DDoS attacks orchestrated by hacktivist groups such as Anonymous Sudan against prominent entities like BAZAN Group and Thuraya Mobile Satellite Communications Company highlight the growing cybersecurity threats targeting critical infrastructure. \nBeyond the immediate disruption caused to the targeted organizations, these incidents expose the vulnerable state of IoT devices. DDoS attacks not only compromise the functionality of essential services but also serve as potent tools for expressing political or ideological grievances. \nThe danger lies not just in the immediate impact on the targeted entities but in the potential ripple effects, affecting users, businesses, and, in the case of BAZAN Group, the broader energy sector. \nAs cybersecurity threats evolve in sophistication and scale, the need for strong security measures becomes increasingly crucial to safeguard against potential economic, social, and geopolitical consequences arising from such malicious activities.\nMalware Exploits 9Hits, Turns Docker Servers into Traffic Boosted Crypto Miners\nCado Security researchers have discovered a new campaign targeting vulnerable Docker servers, deploying two containers – a regular XMRig miner and the 9hits viewer application. This is the first documented case of malware deploying the 9Hits Traffic Exchange viewer application as a payload. \nFor your information, 9hits is a platform where members buy credits for traffic generated on their website and can run the viewer app to visit requested websites in exchange for credits.\nResearchers suspect that the attackers discovered the honeypot via Shodan or a similar service, as their IP isn’t included in common abuse databases, or they may be using a different server for scanning. \nFurther probing revealed that the attacker is likely using a script to set the DOCKER_HOST variable and run the regular CLI to compromise the server. They fetch off-the-shelf images from Dockerhub for their 9hits and XMRig software, a common attack vector for campaigns targeting Docker.\nGenerally, attackers use a generic Alpine image to break out of a container and run malware on the host. In this campaign, however, they do not try to exit the container and run it with a predetermined argument.\nThe spreader initiates the infection using a custom command to invoke a Docker container, including configuration\/session identifiers. The nh.sh process is the entry point, and after the attacker adds their session token, it allows the 9hits app to authenticate with their servers and fetches a list of sites to visit. Once the app has visited the site, the session token owner is awarded a credit on the 9hits platform.\nIt is worth noting that the session token system is designed to work in untrusted contexts, allowing the app to be run in illegitimate campaigns without the risk of the attacker’s account being compromised.\n9hits, a headless Chrome app, is used to visit various websites, including adult and pop-up sites. In 2017, Chrome 59 introduced Headless mode, allowing users to run the browser in an unattended environment without visible UI, making it popular for browser automation with projects like Puppeteer or ChromeDriver.\nExposure to Docker hosts remains a common entry vector for attackers, emphasizing the importance of maintaining system security to prevent malicious use of systems. The campaign significantly impacts compromised hosts by exhausting CPU resources, causing legitimate workloads to fail. \nAdditionally, it could potentially leave a remote shell on the system, causing a more serious breach. This highlights the ongoing trend of attackers seeking new strategies to exploit compromised hosts.\nAnonymous Sudan Claims London Internet Exchange Attack Over Yemen Strikes\nAnonymous Sudan, a Russia-affiliated hacktivist group comprising members from various backgrounds, has claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on the London Internet Exchange (LINX). It is one of the world’s largest exchange points.\nThe London Internet Exchange (LINX) is a mutually governed Internet exchange point (IXP) based in London, UK. It provides peering services and public policy representation to network operators within the UK and beyond.\nThe group claims its cyber attack to be a response to Britain’s support to Israel and the launching of air attacks on Yemen. Anonymous Sudan has also threatened to cause a major setback to the UK with a big cyberattack in the coming days. \nOn January 12, 2023, on its Telegram channel, the group posted about the attack on LINX, but this claim is yet to be confirmed. However, according to a tweet from OSINT specialists at CyberKnow, LINX’s website remained online amid the group’s claims, leaving questions about the authenticity of the claims or if they are merely speculation.\nFor your information, the UK and the USA launched air strikes against Houthi military targets in Yemen. The UK targeted 30 Houthi military sites using 150 precision-guided munitions, killing five militants. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak approved the military action. \nBritain’s move was a response to Houthi attacks on international maritime vessels in the Red Sea. US officials reportedly fired over 80 Tomahawk cruise missiles from three destroyers and a submarine. The action also involved 22 jets from the USS Eisenhower aircraft carrier.\nAnonymous Sudan is known for using massive DDoS attacks, targeting both anti-Russian and anti-Muslim groups\/entities. Lately, they have been launching attacks almost weekly, targeting airlines, governments, banks, large enterprises, airports, and telcos. \nIn November 2023, the same group also claimed responsibility for DDoS attacks on ChatGPT and caused service disruptions. They were previously involved in cyber attacks on Microsoft’s flagship office suite, including popular applications like Outlook and OneDrive, as well as its Azure cloud computing platform back in June 2023.\nSince its inception, Anonymous Sudan has been active on Telegram, warning about potential attacks and updating them live. Its key targets include Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s websites, Mossad, and also collaborated with Killnet.\nWindows Defender SmartScreen Vulnerability Exploited with Phemedrone Stealer\nThe vulnerability was patched on November 14, 2023, but the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added it to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list due to evidence of in-the-wild exploitation. Since its discovery, numerous malware campaigns, including the Phemedrone Stealer payload, have exploited it in their attack chains.\nCybersecurity researchers at Trend Micro have discovered that a vulnerability affecting Microsoft Windows Defender SmartScreen, tracked as CVE-2023-36025, is being exploited to infect users with Phemedrone Stealer. \nFor your information, Windows Defender SmartScreen is a built-in security feature in Microsoft Windows 8 and later that helps protect users from malicious websites, downloads, and applications. It acts as a first line of defence against a variety of threats, including phishing websites, malicious downloads and untrusted applications.\nThis open-source malware strain targets web browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and messaging apps like Telegram, Steam, and Discord. Its additional capabilities allow the malware to take screenshots gather system information such as hardware details and location data and send stolen data to attackers via Telegram or their C2 server. Phemedrone Stealer is maintained on GitHub and Telegram.\nReportedly, hackers use social media to spread URL files that appear as harmless link shortcuts, which are then downloaded and run by clicking on them. The infection process begins with an attacker hosting malicious Internet Shortcut files on cloud services like Discord or FileTransfer.io, disguised using URL shorteners like shorturl.at. An unsuspecting user may be tricked into opening a maliciously crafted.url file that exploits CVE-2023-36025.\nThe attackers craft a Windows shortcut (.url) file to evade the SmartScreen protection prompt by employing a .cpl file as part of a malicious payload delivery mechanism. The.cpl file is executed through the Windows Control Panel process binary, calling rundll32.exe to execute a malicious DLL.\nThe malware, hosted on GitHub, downloads a ZIP file containing three files: WerFaultSecure.exe, Wer.dll, and Secure.pdf. The wer.dll file is crucial for the loader’s functionality. The attacker executes the loader using DLL sideloading, spoofing a malicious DLL file in the application’s directory. \nThe DATA3.txt file masks its contents, making deciphering its purpose difficult. The malware collects system information, compresses it into a ZIP file, and sends the compressed data to the attacker via SendMessage and SendZip methods. Through techniques like API hashing and string encryption, the malware evades detection and complicates reverse engineering.\nCVE-2023-36025, having a CVSS score of 8.8, affects Microsoft Windows Defender SmartScreen because of its lack of checks on Internet Shortcut files, allowing attackers to create.url files and execute malicious scripts. \nThe vulnerability was patched on November 14, 2023, but the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added it to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list due to evidence of in-the-wild exploitation. Since its discovery, numerous malware campaigns, including the Phemedrone Stealer payload, have exploited it in their attack chains.\nTo stay protected, developers should regularly update their operating systems, apps, and security solutions, be cautious with Internet Shortcut files, and implement advanced solutions like real-time monitoring and threat detection capabilities.\nBritish Cosmetics Retailer Lush Investigating Cyber Attack\nLush Retail Ltd., a British cosmetics retailer is surrounded by uncertainty after confirming a cybersecurity incident is brewing within the company. While details remain scarce, the news has left customers and industry experts alike wondering just how deep the fragrant rabbit hole goes.\nThe company broke the news through a brief statement, admitting they are “currently responding to a cybersecurity incident,” but stopping short of revealing the attack’s nature or potential targets. This cryptic stance has only fueled speculation, with concerns ranging from customer data breaches to operational disruptions.\n“We take cybersecurity exceptionally seriously,” stressed the statement, attempting to quell rising worry. “We have informed relevant authorities and are working with external IT forensic specialists to conduct a thorough investigation.”\nThis move suggests the attack might be more than a minor hiccup, potentially involving sensitive data or wider security implications. The potential scenarios storming around this incident paint a troubling picture:\nExperts caution against complacency, urging users to remain vigilant towards suspicious emails or communications claiming to be from Lush.\n“It hasn’t been confirmed what type of attack Lush is facing, but it does sound like ransomware,” said William Wright, CEO of Closed Door Security. “The threat is used to take an organisation’s data hostage, so a big part of recovery is working on containing the attack and limiting its spread.”\n“More details should be released around the attack, but the most worrying issue with the incident is the type of data criminals could potentially have access to. Whether it be company data, or sensitive customer information, given the popularity of Lush it will undoubtedly be a gold mine for criminals,” Wright warned.\nWhile the investigation unfolds, Lush customers can take proactive steps:\nShould Lush decide to disclose additional information about the cyber attack, Hackread.com will update this article accordingly. However, one certainty remains: the United Kingdom has been experiencing an unprecedented surge in cyber attacks over the past few months.\nEarlier this month, it was reported that hackers launched a calculated cyber attack on the UK’s Nuclear Waste Services through LinkedIn. A few months before that, in November 2023, Samsung disclosed a data breach in which hackers stole customer data in the UK.\nIn October 2023, UK power and data manufacturer Volex fell victim to a cyber attack. During the same month, reports surfaced that Vietnamese DarkGate malware targeted META accounts nationwide.\nForescout Report Uncovers New Details in Danish Energy Hack\nForescout, a global cybersecurity leader, has provided new evidence about two attacks on the Danish energy sector in May 2023 (PDF). Their report, ‘Clearing the Fog of War,’ highlights the need for better network monitoring and incident response plans and analyzes the potential involvement of an advanced persistent threat (APT) group called Sandworm.\nFor your information, SektorCERT, Denmark’s critical infrastructure CERT, reported a significant cyber-related attack on 22 Danish energy sector companies between May 11-30, 2023. The attacks, linked to Russian APT Sandworm, exploited vulnerabilities in Zyxel firewalls. Despite SektorCERT’s swift response, some companies were forced into island mode, allowing attackers to access industrial control systems.\nForescout Research-Vedere Labs report shed light on this incident. Reportedly, the first wave of attacks started on May 11, 2023, exploiting CVE-2023-28771, a pre-authentication OS command injection vulnerability in unpatched Zyxel firewalls. \nA second wave occurred on May 22, 2023, where attackers downloaded MIPS binaries from 45.89.106147 to Zyxel firewalls in an energy sector organization containing Mirai variants with Moobot flavour indicators. The firewalls participated in DDoS and SSH brute-force attacks against targets in Hong Kong, the U.S., and Canada.\nZyxel firewalls at other SektorCERT member organizations were also observed downloading Mirai variants from staging servers, historically associated with malware distribution, adware, ransomware, and Log4j exploitation attempts.\n “After the second incident, further attacks targeted exposed devices within critical infrastructure worldwide in the ensuing months,” the report read.\nResearchers couldn’t fully attribute the attacks to Sandworm given the difference between the two waves. The first wave targeted a limited number of targets using a PoC-less n-day while the second wave involved Zyxel firewalls infected by staging servers with a history of mass exploitation and crimeware, explained Elisa Costante, VP of Research at Forescout Research–Vedere Labs.\nThe study found numerous IP addresses exploiting the Zyxel vulnerability CVE-2023-28771, first reported by TRAPA Security in June 2023 and added to the CISA KEV catalogue in May 2023 with a 9.8 severity rating.\nIn April 2023, Zyxel announced patches for impacted firewalls, including USG Flex, ATP, ZyWALL\/USG, and VPN. However, FortiGuard Labs reported a rise in DDoS botnets exploiting the Zyxel vulnerability, which persisted as late as October 2023 and spread across various devices, including Zyxel firewalls.\nIn May 2023, Hackread reported how a variant of the Mirai botnet, IZ1H9, successfully hacked Zyxel Firewalls using a patched command injection vulnerability, potentially leading to DDoS attacks. Researchers from Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 identified it as the most active Mirai variant.\nEurope faces high exploitation attempts, with 80% of publicly identifiable and potentially vulnerable firewalls located there. Six European power companies are at risk of exploitation by malicious actors due to their use of Zyxel firewalls, highlighting the need for prioritizing threat intelligence in the energy sector.\nLiving off the land (LotL) attacks offer stealth benefits, allowing attackers to abstract away from legacy\/proprietary protocols. Energy firms and critical infrastructure organizations must remain alert to attacks on unpatched network infrastructure devices.\nFor insight into the new development, we reached out to John Gallagher, Vice President of Viakoo Labs at Viakoo who praised Forescout for “digging deeper into exploits against critical infrastructure, and getting closer to the truth of what is behind these attacks.”\n“Getting a more accurate assessment of these attack vectors, and getting to that truth more quickly as Forescout has provided, is crucial in protecting these critical assets. Disrupting cyber adversaries in their efforts is one form of defence; that’s why getting specific as to who is the threat actor is critical to defending ICS infrastructure,” he said.\n“Forescout’s analysis points to the spillover from nation-state-directed cyber exploits to mass exploitation campaigns, which is an alarming trend. As “mass market” threat actors become more skilled at working within the unique languages and protocols of ICS systems it dramatically increases the risk of non-affiliated threat actors providing “as a service” ICS exploitation,” John added.\n“In addition, this means organizations who depend on IoT\/OT\/ISC systems will be direct targets at some point to the same threats being launched against national critical infrastructure.”\nJose Seara, CEO and founder at DeNexus emphasizes the need for companies to “strengthen their cybersecurity posture” by understanding their cyber risks, identifying them, and quantifying them in monetary terms.\n“Critical infrastructure and industrial sites have been increasingly targeted by threat actors and they all need to strengthen their cybersecurity posture. It is imperative for these companies to better understand their cyber risks, identify them and quantify them in monetary terms to drive data-driven decisions on cybersecurity investments,” said Jose. \n“Additionally, new SEC regulations on cybersecurity reporting in the U.S. and the NIS2 in Europe are mandating the reporting cyber risk management, expanding the associated consequences of attacks beyond standard security concerns and putting organizations who do not comply at risk of potential legal and financial implications,” he added.\nMirai-based NoaBot Botnet Targeting Linux Systems with Cryptominer\nCybersecurity researchers at Akamai have discovered cryptomining malware called NoaBot based on the notorious Mirai botnet. The crytojacking malware NoaBot is currently targeting Linux servers and has been active since January 2023. \nAccording to Akamai, a noticeable difference between NoaBot and Mirai is that rather than DDoS attacks (Distributed Denial of Service attacks), the malware targets weak passwords connecting SSH connections and installs cryptocurrency mining software, allowing attackers to generate digital coins using victims’ computing resources, electricity, and bandwidth. \nHere, it is important to mention that NoaBot malware has also been used to deliver P2PInfect, a separate worm discovered by Palo Alto Networks in July 2023.\nNoaBot is compiled using the UClibc code library, unlike the standard Mirai library. This changes how the antivirus protections detect NoaBot, categorizing it as an SSH scanner or generic trojan. The malware is statically compiled and stripped of symbols, while strings are obfuscated instead of saved as plaintext, making it harder for reverse engineers to extract details.\nThe NoaBot binary runs from a randomly generated folder, making searching devices harder. The standard Mirai dictionary is replaced with a large one, and a custom-made SSH scanner is used. Post-breach capabilities include installing a new SSH-authorized key.\nThis botnet has grown significantly, with over 800 unique IP addresses worldwide showing signs of NoaBot infections. The worm is a customized version of Mirai, a malware that infects Linux-based servers, routers, web cameras, and other Internet of Things devices.\nInterestingly, the malware includes embedded song lyrics from the “Who’s Ready for Tomorrow” song by Rat Boy and IBDY, but later samples do not have these. The botnet also adds command line arguments, such as the “noa” flag, which installs a persistence method after a reboot.\nThreat actors modified the XMRig miner to extract the mining configuration before execution. The miner’s functions involve function calls and signals. The configuration contains the mining pool and wallet address details. However, IDA misses the binary name and pool IP placeholder, allowing attackers to estimate the profitability of the cryptomining gig.\nResearchers noted that the attackers were running their private pool instead of a public one, eliminating the need for a wallet. However, domains are no longer resolvable with Google’s DNS, and no recent incidents involving the dropping of the miner are noticed, suggesting the threat actors may have halted the campaign for better opportunities.\nHackread has been following incidents involving Mirai since it was discovered in 2016. Mirai is a self-replicating malware targeting Linux-based IoT devices, used to infect other vulnerable devices. \nIn 2016, it was used in a massive DDoS attack against Dyn DNS, paralyzing the internet. The creators released the source code, allowing crime groups to incorporate it into their attacks. Mirai scans the internet for Telnet connections via infected devices to crack Telnet passwords, then targets additional devices using the same technique.\nAkamai urges Linux server administrators to protect their systems from NoaBot by keeping software updated, using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and monitoring unauthorized activity. This is crucial as NoaBot can launch DDoS, data breaches, and cryptojacking attacks.\nDefunct Ambulance Service Data Breach Impacts Nearly 1 Million People\nFallon Ambulance Services, a subsidiary of Transformative Healthcare and now-defunct Ambulance Service, covering the greater Boston area in the United States, was targeted by a ransomware attack, exposing nearly a million people.\nAccording to the breach notification submitted to the Maine Attorney General, around 911,757 individuals nationwide, including 20,486 Maine residents, have been affected by the attack which occurred on 17 February 2023 and was discovered on 21 April 2023. \nThe perpetrator accessed a server containing patient information, which the company claims was stored to “comply with legal obligations.” Fallon Ambulance Services had ceased operations in December 2022. However, in April 2023, Transformative detected suspicious activity within its data storage archive from late February 2023 to late April 2023. \nThe company hired third-party cybersecurity specialists for an investigation. Initial probing revealed that files were obtained by an “unauthorized party,” possibly containing personal information and COVID-19 testing information. \nAccording to the company’s notification, the exposed data included names, driver’s license numbers, and non-driver identification card numbers. Maine residents were notified in writing on 27 December 2023. \nThe Maine Attorney General urges those who received ambulance services from Fallon Ambulance Service between February and December 2022 to be vigilant and take steps to protect themselves, including regular credit report reviews, freezing, and being wary of phishing scams and unsolicited calls or emails from Transformative Healthcare or credit bureaus.\nThe ALPHV ransomware gang, whose domains were recently seized by security agencies, claimed Transformative Healthcare, as a victim in late April 2023, exporting a terabyte of data, including medical\/paramedics reports and patient details.\nBefore law enforcement cracked down, the ALPHV ransomware gang had already snagged several high-profile victims, including MGM Resorts, NCR Data Center, Amazon’s Ring, Reddit, and more.\nTransformative Healthcare, which acquired Fallon Ambulance Service in September 2022, is offering free identity theft protection services to impacted customers. \nThe healthcare sector has been facing severe cyber attacks. According to the latest report from cybersecurity firms, hackers have been deliberately targeting hospitals and emergency services to gain malicious advantages.\nThe Transformative data breach shows how important it is to have strong security in healthcare. Nowadays, healthcare uses a lot of digital systems, so it’s crucial to put in place strong security measures to protect patients’ private information.\nMintlify Confirms Data Breach Through Compromised GitHub Tokens\nA security breach at a software documentation platform, Mintlify, has allowed unauthorized access to 91 GitHub tokens, raising concerns about the potential exposure of private repositories and the need for improved security measures to protect user data. \nFor your information, Mintlify assists developers in creating software documentation by requesting access to customers’ GitHub repositories, including fintech, database, and AI startups.\nOn March 1st, an email raised security concerns about endpoints’ security, leading to unusual requests from an unrecognized device. Some of these requests targeted sensitive API endpoints. \nMintlify blames the breach on a vulnerability in its systems, discovered by a bug bounty reporter, which allowed the attackers to gain access to private admin tokens, causing unauthorized entry into the system.\nIt is worth noting that private tokens on GitHub enable users to share account access with third-party apps such as Mintlify. If stolen, attackers could access source code levels as permitted.\nInitial probing revealed that compromised GitHub tokens were used to access a customer’s repository, with no evidence suggesting other repositories were accessed.\nThe company took immediate action by revoking all GitHub token access, rotating admin access tokens, and implementing stringent security measures to mitigate further unauthorized access. \nFurthermore, the vulnerability that exposed admin access tokens was patched. The company is deprecating private tokens to prevent similar incidents and working with GitHub and customers to determine if any other tokens were used by the attacker.\n“The users have been notified, and we’re working with GitHub to identify whether the tokens were used to access private repositories,” the startup’s co-founder Hang Wang noted in the blog post.\nThe extent of the data breach remains unclear. Nevertheless, Mintlify has collaborated with third-party cybersecurity vendors to conduct a thorough investigation and implemented security measures. This includes improving API endpoint monitoring systems, establishing a robust security policy, launching a bounty program for ethical hackers, and re-auditing its 2024 SOC 2 certification. to prevent unauthorized access and ensure user security.\nMintlify advises users to change their password, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), monitor emails for suspicious activity, and review API key permissions. The incident underscores the need to improve cybersecurity for cryptocurrency exchanges, emphasizing the importance of strong passwords and 2FA.\nIranian Food Delivery Giant Snappfood Cyber Attack: 3TB of Data Stolen\nSnappfood, a prominent online food delivery service in Iran, has fallen victim to a major data breach, during which cybercriminals stole personal information of millions of customers, Hackread.com can confirm.\nOperating similarly to other food delivery platforms, Snappfood facilitates users in Iran to conveniently order food from a diverse range of restaurants through its mobile app or website, subsequently having it delivered to their doorstep. It forms part of the larger Snapp group, which includes Snapp’s ride-hailing services.\nIn the wake of this data breach, an individual operating under the alias “irleaks” (presumably indicating Iran Leaks) publicly disclosed a sample of the stolen data on the notorious Breach Forums, indicating the specifics of the compromised information.\nAs seen by Hackread.com, the hacker claimed to have acquired an extensive trove of data exceeding 3TB. Allegedly, the stolen records include:\nWhile the official Snappfood Iran website was inaccessible at the time of writing this article, on December 31, 2023, the company publicly acknowledged the breach on Twitter (now X), acknowledging the issue. Snappfood’s social media representative disclosed that Iran’s Cyber Police (FATA) is actively working to identify the breach’s source.\nHowever, the company maintains that customers’ payment data, especially card security codes (CCV), passwords, and expiration dates, remain secure and were not accessed by hackers.\nIn a subsequent tweet on January 1, 2024, Snappfood claimed that an agreement had been reached with the hacker group, preventing the sale or leakage of the data online. While the specifics of the agreement remain undisclosed, Snappfood’s claim appears substantial, given that the hacker group had deleted their post from Breach Forums and removed the sample link previously shared on the forum and their Telegram channel at the time of writing.\nAdditionally, a post from the hackers on their Telegram channel confirms the agreement and outlines the next steps for the affected company and customers. The following content has been translated using Google Translate:\nNevertheless, if both parties adhere to their agreement, it could be deemed a positive outcome for the company and its customers. Hackread.com has reached out to the hackers for a potential interview about the data breach, and this article will be updated accordingly if they respond.\nThe identity of “irleaks” remains unknown, but the group is known for communicating in the Persian language. This is the same group that, in August 2023, was selling insurance data of Iranian citizens on the well-known private Russian hacker forum Exploit.in.\nThis incident is not the first instance of a high-profile company like Snappfood falling victim to a data breach. In April 2019, TAP30 (now TAPSI) exposed its database, revealing the personal details of millions of drivers and customers. Additionally, in May 2021, the Raychat app, a popular Iranian social and business messaging platform, was hacked, resulting in the leakage of data from more than 150 million users.\nHackers Attack UK’s Nuclear Waste Services Through LinkedIn\nThe United Kingdom’s Radioactive Waste Management (RWM) company overseeing the nation’s radioactive waste has revealed a recent cyberattack attempt through LinkedIn. While the attack was reportedly unsuccessful, it has raised eyebrows in the nuclear sector, sparking concerns about the security of critical nuclear infrastructure.\nAs reported by The Guardian, the hackers directed their attack at the company through LinkedIn. However, whether it was a phishing attack or an attempt to trick employees into installing malware on the system, the modus operandi remains unknown.\nTypically, LinkedIn is exploited for phishing scams targeting employees of specific companies. An example from last year involves ESET researchers reporting a cyberespionage campaign by North Korean government-backed hackers from the Lazarus group. The campaign specifically targeted employees at a Spanish aerospace firm.\nThe RWM is spearheading the £50bn Geological Disposal Facility (GDF) project, aimed at constructing a substantial underground nuclear waste repository in Britain. As a government-owned entity, RWM facilitated the merger of three nuclear bodies—the GDF project, the Low-Level Waste Repository, and another waste management entity—to establish Nuclear Waste Services (NWS).\n“NWS has seen, like many other UK businesses, that LinkedIn has been used as a source to identify the people who work within our business. These attempts were detected and denied through our multi-layered defences,” stated an NWS spokesperson.\nHowever, the incident raises concerns, as experts warn that social media platforms such as LinkedIn are becoming preferred playgrounds for hackers. These platforms provide multiple avenues for infiltration, including the creation of fake accounts, phishing messages, and direct credential theft.\nThe FBI’s special agent in charge of the San Francisco and Sacramento field offices, Sean Ragan, has emphasized the ‘significant threat’ of fraudsters exploiting LinkedIn to lure users into cryptocurrency investment schemes, citing numerous potential victims and past and current cases. \nIn October 2023, email security firm Cofense discovered a phishing campaign abusing Smart Links, part of the LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Enterprise service, to send authentic-looking emails, steal payment data, and bypass email protection mechanisms. \nIn November 2023, a LinkedIn database containing over 35 million users’ personal information was leaked by a hacker named USDoD, who previously breached the FBI’s InfraGard platform. The database was obtained through web scraping, an automated process to extract data from websites.\nSocial engineering attacks, such as deceptive emails and malicious links, offer hackers a gateway to sensitive information. LinkedIn has taken steps to warn users about potential scams and provide resources for staying safe online. Still, concerns about digital security remain prevalent in the nuclear industry, especially after the Guardian exposé of cybersecurity vulnerabilities at the Sellafield plant. \nIn 2023, the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria experienced cybersecurity issues, indicating a need for improved safeguards and tighter regulations. The RWM incident highlights the growing interest of cybercrime syndicates to target nuclear sites.\nThe NWS acknowledges the need for continuous improvement to strengthen cybersecurity measures, highlighting that emergency response plans must match evolving business needs.\nMicrosoft Disables App Installer After Feature is Abused for Malware\nThe ms-appinstaller URI scheme, which allows users to download and install apps directly from websites using the MSIX package installer, is being abused in malicious activities, reports Microsoft Threat Intelligence.\nResearchers found that ‘financially motivated’ threat actors use the ms-appinstaller URI scheme for malware distribution, prompting Microsoft to disable the protocol handler by default.\nFor your information, the ms-appinstaller URI scheme lets websites skip the download-and-install step, directly installing apps with seamless convenience. \nHowever, the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) found that cyber criminals were abusing the feature through “social engineering and phishing techniques” to get people to download malicious apps via this protocol. \nReportedly, it is used as an access vector for malware, potentially leading to ransomware distribution. Cybercriminals are selling a malware kit that exploits the MSIX file format and handler. They distribute signed malicious packages through websites and malicious advertisements for popular software. \nThe threat actors likely chose this vector because it can bypass security measures like Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and browser warnings when downloading executables. The extent of this activity remains unknown. However, multiple threat actors are abusing this feature.\nThis vector is likely chosen because it can bypass security measures like Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and browser warnings when downloading executables. The extent of this activity remains unknown. However, multiple threat actors are abusing this feature.\nAccording to Mircosoft’s blog post, in mid-November, Microsoft detected Storm-1113’s EugenLoader malware delivered through search advertisements mimicking the Zoom app. When someone accesses a compromised website, a malicious MSIX installer is downloaded along with additional payloads, including malware like Gozi, Redline stealer, IcedID, Smoke Loader, NetSupport Manager, Sectop RAT, and Lumma stealer. \nThe same month, the cybercriminal group Sangria Tempest used EugenLoader and Carbanak backdoors to deliver malware implants. It also used Google ads to lure users into downloading malicious MSIX packages, leading to the delivery of POWERTRASH, which loads NetSupport and Gracewire, typically associated with Lace Tempest.\nIn early December, Storm-0569 was observed distributing BATLOADER through SEO poisoning, spoofing legitimate software downloads like Zoom, Tableau, TeamViewer, and AnyDesk. \nAround the same time, Storm-1674 delivered fake landing pages through messages on Teams, spoofing Microsoft services like OneDrive and SharePoint. Tenants created by the threat actor lure users into downloading spoofed applications, likely dropping SectopRAT or DarkGate.\nThe MSRC has released an “important” security update for CVE-2021-43890, which disables the ms-appinstaller URI scheme handler in App Installer build 1.21.3421.0. This means users cannot download and install apps from websites using this protocol. \nInstead, the MSIX package is downloaded to a storage device, and users must manually install the app. Microsoft will continue to monitor malicious activity and advises against downloading or installing apps from unknown websites.\nTo reduce the threat, Microsoft recommends implementing phishing-resistant authentication methods for users, Conditional Access authentication strength for employees and external users for critical apps, and educating Microsoft Teams users to verify external tagging on communication attempts.\niPhone Spyware Exploits Obscure Chip Feature, Targets Researchers\nKaspersky Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) has discovered an obscure hardware feature likely exploited by hackers during spyware attacks against iPhone users.\nThe attacks were part of an APT campaign dubbed Operation Triangulation, which has been active since 2019, targeting iOS devices Using zero-click exploits via iMessage, allowing attackers to gain control and access user data. It was discovered by Kaspersky this summer.\nThe yet publicly undocumented feature is a part of Apple’s system-on-a-chip (SoC) and was probably included in the iPhone for debugging or testing purposes by Apple engineers, or added in the final consumer version mistakenly. Nevertheless, it allowed attackers to bypass protections and hijack devices in attacks targeting Kaspersky senior employees’ iPhones.\nThe research into Operation Triangulation was conducted by the cybersecurity vendor, Kaspersky. It is worth noting that the operation kicked off when Kaspersky researchers identified that their employees’ iPhones were hacked by spyware.\nOn December 27, 2023, the company shared the findings in a presentation titled “Operation Triangulation: What You Get When Attack iPhones of Researchers” at the 37th Chaos Communication Congress held in Hamburg and published in a report authored by Boris Larin.\nDuring the presentation, researchers explained that multiple iOS zero-day vulnerabilities (including an RCE issue in Apple’s ADJUST TrueType font instruction CVE-2023-41990 and CVE-2023-38606, a bypass of hardware-based security protections) were exploited to execute code and install a stealthy spyware implant, known as TriangleDB.\nThese vulnerabilities were used to target iPhones running iOS versions up to iOS 16.6. The most critical of these was CVE-2023-38606 for allowing a JavaScript exploit to bypass the Page Protection Layer.\nThe attackers used malicious iMessage attachments to exploit a remote code execution zero-day and deploy TriangleDB without user interaction. The infection chain involved multiple checks and log-erasing actions to prevent malware identification. Researchers discovered new attacks\/exploits daily, calling it the most sophisticated chain of attack they had ever witnessed.  \n“We have discovered and reported more than thirty in-the-wild zero-days in Adobe, Apple, Google, and Microsoft products, but this is the most sophisticated attack chain we have ever seen.”\nThe obscure feature allowed overriding of hardware-based security to protect the kernel, the core part of an operating system. Attackers could then write data to a specific physical address while “bypassing hardware-based memory protection by writing the data, destination address, and data hash to unknown hardware registers of the chip unused by the firmware.” \nThe attackers exploited MMIO registers from the GPU coprocessor, bypassing Apple’s DeviceTree ranges to write to memory, bypass protections, and achieve RCE.\nApple responded by releasing security updates to address four zero-day vulnerabilities impacting various Apple products: CVE-2023-32434, CVE-2023-32435, CVE-2023-38606, and CVE-2023-41990. \nHowever, there are still many unanswered questions, such as the purpose of this feature, how attackers learned to use it considering that the firmware didn’t use it and whether it was developed by Apple or a third-party component like ARM CoreSight.\nRingGo, ParkMobile Owner EasyPark Suffers Data Breach, User Data Stolen\nA data breach has compromised the information of thousands of EasyPark Group customers in Europe. EasyPark Group, Europe’s largest parking app operator, which includes RingGo and ParkMobile, discovered the breach on December 10th, 2023, and promptly informed the affected customers.\nThe company reported the cyber attack to regulatory authorities, including the EU’s privacy regulator, Sweden’s Information Commissioner’s Office, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office, and the Swiss data regulator.\nIt is worth noting that the ParkMobile app, a free parking app in Atlanta, GA, has been targeted by cyberattacks before. In March 2021, as reported by Hackread.com, a vulnerability in third-party software led to a data breach in which hackers leaked over 21 million customers’ records online, including email addresses, phone numbers, license plate numbers, and hashed passwords.\nSome high-profile individuals whose data was leaked in the breach included Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs was also among those affected by the breach.\nIn the latest data breach, the cyber attack reportedly resulted in the theft of customer data, including names, phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, and credit card numbers. The breach involved “a few digits of IBAN or credit card numbers,” but no combination could be used for payments, the company noted while suggesting users be cautious of phishing scams.\nEasyPark Group noted that its ParkMobile app, boasting 50 million users in the US, is unaffected whereas RingGo app users have been affected since some of its services were linked with the EasyPark technology.\nThe company did not disclose the number of affected users, but according to its spokesperson, most are located in Europe whereas 950 RingGo app users in the UK could be affected. So far, hackers haven’t made ransom demands and there’s no evidence of the hacked data being exploited or leaked.\nThe latest EasyPark data breach highlights the increasing data security threat to parking services and customers worldwide. The fact that users have no option but to link their personal details and financial data with these platforms constantly puts their privacy and security at risk of being compromised.\nTeam Hackread.com is monitoring prominent cybercrime and hacker forums for potential data leaks. If EasyPark Group’s data surfaces on any of these forums, we will update this article. Stay tuned.\nUbisoft Hackers Scrambled for 900GB of Data Before Foiled\nAccording to sources, an unknown threat actor accessed Ubisoft’s internal tools on December 20th, allegedly aiming to obtain 900GB of data. After entering the French game publisher’s internal systems, the hacker reviewed users’ access rights and Microsoft Teams, Confluence, and SharePoint. However, Ubisoft managed to revoke access after 48 hours.\nUbisoft, famous games like Assassin’s Creed and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, is investigating the breach to determine how the “unknown threat actor” allegedly gained access to the company’s Microsoft Teams, Confluence, Atlas, and SharePoint channels and maintained access for 48 hours before Ubisoft revoked access.\nIt’s worth noting that the latest cybersecurity incident at Ubisoft occurred just a year after the company was compelled to issue a password reset due to a cyber attack linked to Lapsus$.\nThe online malware repository VX-Underground posted about the incident on its X (Twitter) page, explaining that the attackers “aimed” to obtain 900 GB of Ubisoft’s data.\n“December 20th an unknown Threat Actor compromised Ubisoft. The individual had access for roughly 48 hours until the administration realized something was off and access was revoked. They aimed to exfiltrate roughly 900 GB of data but lost access.”\nThe researchers also shared screenshots of Ubisoft’s internal services. Whether the hacker(s) could obtain any data before Ubisoft revoked access or not is still unclear. However, it is suspected that the attackers wanted to obtain Rainbow Six: Siege user data but failed. The company claims to be “aware” of the security incident but hasn’t shared any additional information as yet.\nThis is the second data breach targeting a major video game company this month. Earlier in December, as reported by Hackread.com, Ratchet & Clank and Spider-Man developer Insomniac Games got sensitive employee data\/information regarding unreleased video games stolen in a massive hacking incident. \nThe hacker published detailed plans of Insomniac for the next decade, including unannounced projects, production details, art assets, and employee information. Ransomware group Rhysida took responsibility for the hack and demanded 50 bitcoins to prevent the data from being published publicly.\nIn Ubisoft’s case, so far, there’s no indication that anything of the sort was accessed or leaked. Nevertheless, the resurgence of the trend to target gaming giants is not surprising, as hackers are known to ruin Christmas and holidays for gamers.\nMortgage Giant Mr. Cooper Data Breach; 14 Million Users Impacted\nIn a new cybersecurity incident, Coppell, Texas-based mortgage and loan giant Mr. Cooper has become the latest victim of a cyberattack that may have compromised the sensitive personal information of more than 14 million individuals, impacting both current and former customers. \nThe company, in its data breach notifications to state and federal regulators, disclosed that the incident initially thought to affect 4.3 million current customers now extends its reach to an additional 10 million past customers.\nThe severity of the situation prompted the company to file a data breach notification with the Maine Attorney General, revealing that a staggering total of 14,690,284 individuals could be affected, with 59,917 of them being residents of Maine.\nThe data breach came to light in early November 2023, when Mr. Cooper announced that it had fallen victim to a cyberattack on October 30, 2023. The breach, discovered the following day, prompted the company to take swift and decisive action by shutting down all IT systems. This included the temporary closure of the online payment portal, a vital platform used by customers to manage their loan and mortgage payments.\nThe company is now actively engaged in investigating the extent of the breach and has begun the process of notifying affected individuals. The compromised data is said to include sensitive personal information such as names, email addresses and personal identifiers in combination with Social Security Numbers (SSN), raising concerns about the potential misuse and identity theft implications for the affected customers.\nHowever, Mr. Cooper assures its customers that it is working to enhance its cybersecurity measures to prevent any future breaches. In the meantime, affected individuals are encouraged to remain alert, monitor their financial accounts, and take necessary precautions to safeguard their personal information.\nIn a comment to Hackread.com, Claude Mandy, Chief Evangelist of Data Security at Symmetry Systems highlighted the challenge organizations face with data retention due to legal requirements and business aspirations. Despite the desire to use data for analytics and customer re-engagement, data often remains untouched, leading to breaches that impact both current and past customers.\n“Unfortunately, a lot of organizations are stuck between a rock and a hard place, when it comes to the retention of data. Various laws and legislature require organizations to keep records for over 7 years, but they also hope to attract their past customers back into the fold and plan to leverage it to develop future analytics insights. In reality, this data just lies untouched where it lies, often long past their actual retention policies. Regardless of the reason, it is not unusual to see breaches impacting not only current customers but previous customers too.“\nMandy emphasizes the importance of proactive data management, citing an example where Symmetry Systems enabled a Fortune 100 organization to delete 25% of their cloud assets without business impact. Additionally, he notes that the absence of credit card numbers in Mr. Cooper’s breach may suggest the use of outsourced payment providers that tokenize credit card information for enhanced security.\n“Increasingly our customers with the help of our data-centric monitoring, identify and proactively delete data beyond its retention lifecycle, and further reduce access to sensitive data in a manner commensurate with its actual usage and sensitivity. In one example, we enabled a Fortune 100 organization on Google Cloud to delete over 25% of their cloud assets such as Projects, Identities, and production data without any business impact.“\n“The lack of credit card numbers in the breach notification isn’t exceptionally notable given that Mr Cooper doesn’t offer credit card facilities to its customers, and mortgage companies generally restrict credit card payments for mortgages. For other organizations that do, this may be a sign that they are leveraging an outsourced payment provider that tokenizes (i.e. replaces with a token) credit card numbers to secure them.“\nThe announcement of the data breach at Mr. Cooper came just days after Delta Dental, a dental insurance provider based in Oak Brook, Illinois, United States, revealed that it had experienced a data breach affecting 7 million customers.\nNevertheless, impacted individuals are urged to be watchful for phishing emails that may falsely claim to originate from the company, claiming to provide new updates. However, the actual motive could be to exploit the situation and attempt to steal user data.\nDisruptions at 70% of Iran’s Gas Stations Blamed on Cyberattack\nThis article has been updated with a correction stating that Gonjeshke Darande is not linked to Israel, and there is no evidence that it is backed by the Israeli government.\nA hacking group has claimed responsibility for a cyberattack that reportedly disrupted most gas stations in Iran, leading to long lines and angry crowds. The group, known as “Gonjeshke Darande,” (which means Predatory Sparrow in Persian) cited that the attack was in response to the Islamic Republic’s aggression.\nIn a series of Tweets on X (formerly Twitter) in both English and Persian languages, the group explained the reason behind the attack:\n“We, Gonjeshke Darande, carried out another cyberattack today, taking out a majority of the gas pumps throughout Iran. This cyberattack comes in response to the aggression of the Islamic Republic and its proxies in the region.”\nAddressing Iran’s leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the group said he is playing with fire and will pay the price.\n“Khamenei, playing with fire has a price.”\nIn a statement given to Iran’s state TV, the country’s Oil Minister Javed Owji, said that the attack was caused by external interference and led to service disruption on 70% of Iran’s gas stations. At least 30% of Iran’s gas stations are operational, with the rest gradually resolving service disruptions. \nSome petrol stations, particularly in the capital, have experienced software issues with their fuel systems, and experts are working to fix the issue. The possibility of a cyberattack is also being considered.\nGonjeshke Darande revealed that the attack was conducted in a controlled manner, limiting potential damage to emergency services and ensuring a portion of gas stations were left unharmed. The group also emphasized the precautions taken to avoid harm to civilians, claiming that these companies are subject to international sanctions and continue their operations despite restrictions.\n“We delivered warnings to emergency services across the country before the operation began, and ensured a portion of the gas stations across the country were left unharmed for the same reason, despite our access and capability to completely disrupt their operation,” the attackers noted.\nThis isn’t the first time Gonjeshke Darande has targeted Iranian infrastructure. It claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on Iran’s major steel companies in June 2022. The attack started a fire in a steel factory, releasing top secret documents proving the companies’ affiliation with Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps. The plant’s CEO confirmed no harm\nThe country’s civil defence agency is currently investigating the Monday attack on Iran’s gas stations.\nHackers Access Customer Info, Corporate Systems in MongoDB Data Breach\nUpdate (8:04 AM, Monday, December 18, 2023, Eastern Time (ET)): The login issue has been resolved. MongoDB has provided new information about the breach, and you can find comprehensive coverage of the latest MongoDB update on Hackread.com.\nMongoDB, a leading database management company, has fallen victim to a security incident resulting in unauthorized access to certain corporate systems. The breach, detected on the evening of December 13th, 2023, US Eastern Standard Time, has prompted an immediate and comprehensive investigation by the company.\nThe breach includes the exposure of customer account metadata and contact information, heightening concerns about the potential misuse of sensitive data. MongoDB activated its incident response process upon the discovery of suspicious activities, but it is believed that the unauthorized access may have been ongoing for some time before being detected.\nLena Smart, MongoDB’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), sent an email communication to MongoDB customers, outlining the details of the breach and urging caution in the wake of potential social engineering and phishing threats. The company assures customers that, as of now, there is no indication of exposure to the data stored in MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based database service.\nDespite the incident, MongoDB is actively managing the situation, with ongoing updates promised on their alert page (mongodb.com\/alerts) as the investigation progresses. Relevant authorities have also been notified, underlining the seriousness of the security breach.\nIn a subsequent update at 5:25 PM EST on December 16, 2023, MongoDB reported a spike in login attempts, causing issues for customers attempting to access the MongoDB Atlas and Support Portal. However, MongoDB clarified that this was unrelated to the security incident and advised affected users to try again in a few minutes.\nLena Smart, in her email to customers, emphasized proactive steps to mitigate potential risks. MongoDB recommends customers be vigilant for social engineering and phishing attacks and take immediate action, such as activating phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) and regularly rotating MongoDB Atlas passwords.\nAs the investigation unfolds, MongoDB customers are anxiously awaiting further updates on the situation. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the constant and evolving threats faced by companies in the digital age, underscoring the importance of robust cybersecurity measures and the need for continuous vigilance in safeguarding sensitive customer information.\nRussian APT29 Hacked US Biomedical Giant in TeamCity-Linked Breach\nPolish Military Counterintelligence Service (SKW) has released an advisory revealing that Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) affiliated threat actors are utilizing JetBrains CVE in global targeting. \nHere, it is worth noting that TeamCity and JetBrains are closely linked, with TeamCity being a continuous integration (CI) server developed and maintained by JetBrains.\nAs reported by Hackread.com, the vulnerability, which scored 9.8 by CVSS, was patched in September 2023. However, authorities particularly identified the notorious advanced persistent threat group called APT29, aka the Dukes, CozyBear, and NOBELIUM\/Midnight Blizzard, to be exploiting CVE-2023-42793. \nThe threat actor used Scheduled Tasks to execute GraphicalProton payloads, using rundll32 proxy execution as a defence evasion method. They also used legitimate third-party binaries vulnerable to search order hijacking.\n“If compromised, access to a TeamCity server would provide malicious actors with access to that software developer’s source code, signing certificates, and the ability to subvert software compilation and deployment processes—access a malicious actor could further use to conduct supply chain operations” the advisory read.\nSKW’s findings are supported by the FortiGuard Labs team of researchers. In their latest blog post, FortiGuard reports that APT29 has targeted a US-based biomedical manufacturing organization (the name of which has not been shared with the media or public) and revealed the threat actor’s TTPs. The report discusses the intrusion of this vulnerability found in TeamCity, a Windows server, by APT29.\nResearchers noted that on 6 September 2023, Sonar’s cybersecurity experts discovered a critical TeamCity On-Premises vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2023-42793). This vulnerability was assigned a CVSS score of 9.8 due to its ability to be deployed without authentication. CISA added it to its ‘Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog’ on October 4, 2023.\nThe FortiGuard Incident Response team reports that in October 2023, a US-based biomedical manufacturing organization was compromised due to this vulnerability exploited by APT29. The attack was initially exploited using a custom-built Python script, matching the GraphicalProton malware used by APT29. \nAnalysis of application and system logs revealed evidence of successful exploitation, but some threat actors were unsuccessful at running Linux system commands on the victim Windows Server. APT29 likely employed Nuclei to identify potential victims and began executing additional discovery commands to gather system and privilege information.\nThe US-based tertiary education organization was targeted by APT29 with a C2 IP address discovered by the FortiGuard IR team. They discovered the organization’s infrastructure was compromised and identified an exploitation of their vulnerable TeamCity server. \nThe threat actor used the TeamCity exploit to install an SSH certificate, which they used to maintain access to another victim’s environment. The actor downloaded a DLL file, ‘AclNumsInvertHost.dll,’ on the TeamCity host and used the TeamCity RCE vulnerability to create a Windows-scheduled task referencing the DLL file for persistence. \nDespite a patch, the attacker persisted on the compromised host, leveraging their GraphicalProton implant. FortiGuard believes this attack was part of a new APT29 campaign. Significant OPSEC considerations included compromised infrastructure, search order hijacking with legitimate DLLs added, quality of masquerading, and single-use infrastructure components.\nResearchers recommend containment and eradication actions, including blocking IP addresses, removing TeamCity software accounts, removing Windows accounts, removing backdoors, and removing malicious files dropped by threat actors to stay protected against threats like GraphicalProton.\nNHS Dumfries and Galloway Faces Cyberattack, Patient Data at Risk\nNHS Dumfries and Galloway, a health board serving the southwestern region of Scotland, announced on Friday, March 15, 2024, that it has been targeted by a “focused and ongoing cyber attack.” \nThe nature of the cyber attack remains undisclosed, but the health board has warned that a “significant quantity of data” belonging to patients and staff may have been compromised.\nThe health board has activated its established protocols in response to the attack and is working closely with partner agencies, including Police Scotland, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and the Scottish Government. Their primary focus is on containing the attack, investigating the scope of the breach, and mitigating any potential damage.\nNHS Dumfries and Galloway has also acknowledged the possibility of service disruptions due to the ongoing incident. While the specific nature of these disruptions is yet to be determined, they could potentially impact patient appointments, access to online services, or internal administrative functions.\nThe most concerning aspect of the attack is the potential compromise of patient and staff data. The health board has not yet confirmed the exact type of data accessed, but it could potentially include sensitive information such as names, addresses, medical records, and National Insurance numbers.\nNHS Dumfries and Galloway is urging both staff and patients to be vigilant for any suspicious activity. This includes emails or phone calls attempting to gain access to personal information or financial details. They advise individuals to never click on links or open attachments from unknown senders and to report any suspicious activity immediately.\nFor insights into the incident, we reached out to Richard Staynings, Chief Security Strategist for Cylera, a healthcare cybersecurity that secures 25 NHS Trusts in the UK, who warned of potentially devastating and additional cyber attacks including ransomware on the targeted NHS Dumfries and Galloway systems. \n“Police Scotland and the NCSA will now be looking for malware or simple droppers that could be used to launch a more lucrative ransomware attack on NHS Dumfries and Galloway.”\nRichard emphasised that while the attack is concerning and unfortunate, it may not pose an immediate threat to people’s lives. He further explained that for a cyberattack to directly endanger lives, it would typically need to compromise not only confidentiality (as in the case of potential data exposure) but also system availability or data integrity.\n“It’s a cyberattack that’s unlikely to be a direct risk to life unless a systems availability attack or a data integrity attack accompanies this particular attack against confidentiality. Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) are the three pillars of the Security Triad, he explained.” “All three are required for security. To date, most hospitals have focussed their limited security budgets on protection of confidentiality at the expense of integrity and availability and this is one reason why so many hospitals have been extorted by cyber criminals through ransomware attacks.”\nNevertheless, the attack on NHS Dumfries and Galloway goes on to show the growing threat of cyberattacks on healthcare institutions. With vast amounts of sensitive patient data stored electronically, healthcare providers are becoming increasingly attractive targets for cybercriminals.\nThe full impact of the attack on NHS Dumfries and Galloway is still unfolding. The health board has assured the public that they are taking all necessary steps to investigate the incident, secure their systems, and protect patient data. However, it is likely to take some time before the full extent of the damage is known.\nIn the meantime, patients of NHS Dumfries and Galloway are advised to stay informed by checking the health board’s website for updates. They should also be extra cautious with any unsolicited communication claiming to be from the NHS.\nDelta Dental Hit with 7 Million User Data Breach in MOVEit-Linked Attack\nAccording to a data breach notification, the Oak Brook, Illinois, United States-based dental insurance provider Delta Dental has fallen prey to a sophisticated cyberattack orchestrated through the exploitation of a zero-day flaw in MOVEit Transfer. \nThe notorious Russian-linked ransomware syndicate, known as Cl0p, is behind the breach, compromising the private information of nearly seven million customers. Hackread.com can confirm that the Cl0p ransomware gang has indeed released the entire dataset on its dark web domain, making it available for public download through a torrent.\nDelta Dental’s internal investigation concluded on July 6, has shed light on the severity of the incident. The cybercriminals successfully infiltrated and exfiltrated sensitive data belonging to Delta Dental of California and its affiliated entities on the MOVEit platform during the window between May 27 and May 30. \nThe severity of the situation prompted the company to promptly file a breach notification (PDF) with the Maine Attorney General, officially documenting the security incident on December 14, 2023.\nThe exposed information encompasses a trove of personal and highly sensitive details, presenting a significant risk to the affected individuals. Among the compromised data are names coupled with a combination of addresses, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, or other state identification numbers, passport details, financial account information, tax identification numbers, individual health insurance policy numbers, and various health-related information.\nThis breach not only poses a threat to the privacy and security of Delta Dental’s customers but also raises concerns about the potential misuse of the stolen data. With the involvement of the Cl0p ransomware syndicate, known for its aggressive tactics, the aftermath of this breach could extend beyond typical data exposure scenarios.\nDelta Dental is now faced with the daunting task of mitigating the fallout from this significant security incident. As the affected customers grapple with the potential ramifications of identity theft and financial fraud, cybersecurity experts emphasize the urgency of implementing robust measures to safeguard sensitive information.\nIn a comment to Hackread.com, Claude Mandy, Chief Evangelist of Data Security at Symmetry Systems, expressed empathy for the victims and cautioned them about potential phishing attacks that they may encounter.\n“My thoughts are with the impacted patients from the incident, who are slowly finding out what information has been exposed. While the majority of the information is fungible and easily replaced with little impact, it still requires continual vigilance from the impacted parties to avoid further impact, whether monitoring financial accounts, and credit scores or being extra vigilant for phishing,” said Claude.\nThe recent data breach is concerning for Delta Dental and its customers. It underscores the importance for companies to promptly apply patches and secure their infrastructure. This breach highlights the exploitation of vulnerabilities in Ipswitch INC’s managed file transfer software, MOVEit Transfer, by groups like Cl0p.\nSo far, numerous organizations, spanning government agencies, airlines, educational and financial institutions, as well as healthcare providers, have fallen victim to the MOVEit-linked data breach. The compromised data includes sensitive information such as credit card numbers, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and Social Security Numbers (SSNs).\nNew Hacker Group GambleForce Hacks Targets with Open Source Tools\nIn September 2023, Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence unit discovered a command and control server hosting publicly available open-source pentesting tools, none being custom-made, designed for SQL injections.\nThe attacker was identified as “GambleForce,” who had targeted 24 organizations in government, gambling, retail, travel, and job-seeking sectors across 8 countries between September and December 2023, successfully compromising 6 websites in Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and South Korea. The group has also targeted websites in China, India, and Thailand.\nThe group uses basic yet effective techniques like SQL injections. It exploits vulnerable website content management systems (CMS) to extract user databases containing logins, hashed passwords, and tables from accessible databases.\nGambleForce is not selective in its targets but collects hashed and plain text credentials. This suggests a broader motive beyond targeted attacks, possibly amassing data for future exploits or selling on the dark web. \nThe threat actors aim to exfiltrate any available information within targeted databases, such as hashed and plain text user credentials. The group’s actions with the stolen data remain unknown. \nIn an attack targeting Brazil, GambleForce exploited CVE-2023-23752, a vulnerability in the Joomla CMS, and snatched data directly from contact form submissions, showcasing their adaptability and willingness to improvise.\nFurther probing revealed that GambleForce uses open-source tools like dirsearch, redis-rogue-getshell, and Tinyproxy for directory brute-forcing, web traffic intercepting, and SQL injections to exploit vulnerabilities in database servers. Their preferred tool is sqlmap, a pentesting tool that exploits SQL injection vulnerabilities. \nResearchers also found Cobalt Strike, a popular pen-testing framework, on their server, showcasing commands in Chinese. It is worth noting that recently Chinese scammers have wreaked havoc by creating cloned versions of legitimate websites and redirecting visitors to gambling sites.  \nIn November 2023, Hackread.com reported about the activities of Chinese hackers in which MindaNews, a Philippine newspaper, discovered a Chinese clone of its website (mmart-inn.com) that has been illegally replicating the newspaper’s content for two years, with the most recent translation being from February 2023.\nIn its blog post, Group-IB’s Threat Intelligence wrote that its researchers shared the recent findings with its 24\/7 Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-GIB), which took down the cybercriminals’ C2 server. GambleForce is likely to regroup\/rebuild its infrastructure before launching new attacks.\nNevertheless, the case goes on to show that even the most basic security gaps can have significant consequences, underscoring the need for a layered defence strategy that prioritizes patching known vulnerabilities and implementing vital security controls.\nMicrosoft: Storm-1283 Sent 927,000 Phishing Emails with Malicious OAuth Apps\nMicrosoft has discovered a sophisticated cybercrime scheme by Storm-1283 threat actor who infiltrated a user account to hijack digital keys and mine cryptocurrency within the Microsoft cloud platform Azure. \nAccording to the Microsoft Threat Intelligence unit’s research, the attacker utilized compromised user accounts to establish inbox rules with suspicious names, redirecting emails to the junk folder and marking them as read. Additionally, the malicious OAuth applications created by the actor were responsible for sending over 927,000 phishing emails.\nIn this campaign, hackers exploited the OAuth feature, which permits apps to access user data with proper authorization. They pilfer digital keys, enabling them to cause havoc through phishing or brute force—cracking weak passwords or deceiving users into divulging their login credentials. Once inside, they create or modify OAuth applications with elevated access, effectively transforming them into ‘master keys’ for online resources.\nThese stolen keys are used for cryptocurrency mining, granting hackers lasting access even if passwords are changed. Email and spam sprees are also common, as the master key grants hackers lasting access. \nStorm-1283 breached a user account, gaining access to a virtual private network and tenant domain within Microsoft Entra ID. They created a new “OAuth application” using stolen credentials, allowing them to control resources within the compromised account. \nThey double-dipped existing OAuth applications, adding secret credentials to these keys. With the keys, Storm-1283 deployed virtual machines (VMs) within the compromised Azure subscription, generating cryptocurrency for their illicit gains. They re-entered the cloud, deploying more VMs to maximize their operation. \nThe targeted organizations suffered financial losses ranging from $10,000 to $1.5 million. Microsoft’s security researchers discovered the suspicious activity and exposed the hacker’s tactics, including masking VMs by mimicking the domain name. \nMicrosoft analysts also detected a threat actor who compromised user accounts and created OAuth applications to maintain persistence and launch email phishing activity. The actor used an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing kit to send a significant number of emails with varying subject lines and URLs to target user accounts in multiple organizations. \nMicrosoft worked with the Microsoft Entra team to block the OAuth applications involved in the attack and advised further actions. \nThe company also observed large-scale spamming activity through OAuth applications by Storm-1286. The actor launched password-spraying attacks to compromise user accounts, most of which did not have multifactor authentication (MFA). \nThe user agent BAV2ROPC was observed in sign-in activities related to the compromised accounts, indicating the use of legacy authentication protocols such as IMAP and SMTP that do not support MFA. \nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence has limited the actor’s activity by taking down all malicious OAuth applications related to this campaign, which ran from July to November 2023.\nDoControl‘s Vice President of Solution Consulting, Tim Davis, also commented on this campaign with Hackread.com, urging for making the cloud platform secure.\n“These types of attacks underscore the need for visibility into what both systems and users are doing on any cloud platform. Both limiting of permissions (the least privilege or zero trust model) and robust anomaly detection are critical to protecting resources that are located in the cloud.”\nFujitsu Scrambles After Malware Attack: Customer Data Potentially Breached\nFujitsu is investigating a possible data leak caused by a malware infection that may have allowed unauthorized access to personal information, according to its press release on Friday.\nFujitsu confirmed the presence of malware on multiple work computers, suggesting a potential entry point for unauthorized access. The company quickly launched an investigation. Initial probing has revealed that the malware could have accessed and extracted sensitive personal and customer information. \n“We discovered that files containing personal information and customer information could be illegally taken out,” Fujitsu stated in its press release.\nHowever, the tech giant is yet to confirm the nature of malware used to target its computers, the number of affected computers, and the type of data breached in the attack. Fujitsu discovered the cyberattack on 15 March but has not disclosed other details, including whether contact details, passwords, and payment details were compromised and the time of the attack.\nIt has implemented strict security measures, isolating affected computers and strengthening network surveillance. The company has disconnected affected systems from its network and is investigating the type of malware used, the nature of the cyberattack, and the method of the intrusion. \nFujitsu has not disclosed who has been affected, including employees, corporate customers, and citizens using the company’s technologies. \nThe company claims to be informing “the targeted individuals and customers” about the possible data breach and has notified the Personal Information Protection Commission, Japan’s data protection authority.\n“To date, we have not received any reports that personal information or information about our customers has been misused” the company concluded.\nFujitsu is a leading Japanese ICT company, employing 124,000 people in over 100 countries. The company has been involved in wrongful convictions due to bugs in its Horizon computer software.\nDark Web Tool Arms Ransomware Gangs: E-commerce & Aviation Industries Targeted\nRecent cyber incidents targeting the aerospace and aviation sectors have raised concerns about the industry’s vulnerability to malicious attacks, according to a report by Resecurity. The report highlights the critical need for strong cybersecurity risk assessments to protect airports and aviation infrastructure.\nThe aerospace sector, including the design, manufacturing, and maintenance of aircraft and spacecraft, has become a prime target for cyberattacks due to its reliance on interconnected digital infrastructures and global supply chains. \nThe integration of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies has further strengthened this threat, making aerospace organizations more vulnerable and susceptible to cyber attacks.\nRansomware emerges as a top threat facing the aviation industry, with a 600% increase in occurrences reported by Boeing Chief Security Officer Richard Puckett at the 2023 Aviation Week MRO Americas Conference. \nThe European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) also highlighted ransomware as the sector’s leading attack trend in 2022, accounting for 22% of all malicious incidents. Some of the examples highlighted in the report include the LockBit ransomware gang’s attack on Boeing in November 2023, which the aviation giant later confirmed.\nAccording to Resecurity’s blog post titled “The Aviation And Aerospace Sectors Face Skyrocketing Cyber Threats,” geopolitical tensions and the designation of aerospace and aviation as critical infrastructure by the U.S. government have fueled cyberattacks targeting the industry. \nThreat actors, including hacktivist collectives, are increasingly targeting aviation organizations to advance political agendas or disrupt operations. One such example is the hacktivist group Anonymous Sudan which targeted FlyDubai, an Emirati government-owned airline in Dubai, United Arab Emirates in February 2024 citing the company’s alleged support to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan. \nOther recent cyberattacks targeting the aerospace sector include Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by groups such as Mysterious Team Bangladesh (MTB) against Saudi Arabian airports and ALTOUFAN TEAM against Gulf Air. \n\nIn stand with our steadfast Palestinian people in Gaza Strip in their brave and honorable resistance,ALTOUFAN TEAM targets companies normalized with the Zionist entity , Bahrain International Airport and the Bahraini national carrier “Gulf Air” servers and website…… pic.twitter.com\/OKOhR12M3S\nAdditional incidents involve ransomware attacks on airlines like Air Albania and Continental Aerospace Technologies, compromising critical data and disrupting operations.\nIn another report published on March 13, 2024, Resecurity detailed a new cybersecurity threat named TMChecker that has surfaced on the Dark Web, posing a notable risk to remote-access services and popular e-commerce applications.\nDeveloped by an actor known as “M762” on the Russian language XSS cybercrime forum, TMChecker is a sophisticated tool that combines corporate access login (log) checking capabilities with a brute-force attack kit. Available for a monthly subscription fee of $200, TMChecker has garnered attention for its ability to target a wide range of VPN gateways, email servers, and e-commerce platforms.\nTMChecker stands out from similar tools like ParanoidChecker due to its focus on corporate remote access gateways, which are often primary targets for ransomware attacks and other malicious activities. The tool supports 17 solutions, including Cisco VPN, Citrix VPN, Office 365, WordPress, Magento, and cPanel, among others, making it a versatile and powerful weapon.\nCybercriminals exploit TMChecker to identify compromised data containing valid credentials for corporate VPN and email accounts. In one observed incident, threat actors used TMChecker to target the email server of a government organization in Ecuador, demonstrating the tool’s real-world impact.\nM762 operates a Telegram channel with over 3,270 subscribers, potentially indicating a sizable user base for TMChecker. The addition of such tools aligns with a concerning trend highlighted in recent Microsoft research, which noted a significant increase in human-operated ransomware attacks. \nThese attacks often involve the abuse of remote monitoring and management tools, leaving behind less evidence compared to automated attacks delivered through malicious documents.\nAs TMChecker and similar tools lower the barriers to obtaining remote access credentials, the risk of destructive ransomware attacks and other malicious campaigns amplifies. This threat is particularly acute in the context of mergers and acquisitions, where cybercriminals target vulnerable organizations to exploit for financial gain.\nHackers Claim Accessing 740GB of Data from Viber Messaging App\nThis article has been updated with the latest information including a statement from a Viber spokesperson.\nMessaging app Viber is facing a potential data breach after a pro-Palestinian hacktivist group, Handala Hack, claimed responsibility for accessing its servers and stealing a trove of data.\nIn its Telegram post, Handala Hack alleged they stole over 740GB of data, including Viber’s source code. The group demands a ransom of 8 Bitcoin, or $583,000, for the stolen information.\n“Have you seen the management panel of Viber Messenger before? Can you imagine the technology giants affiliated with the occupying regime, what information of citizens they store?” the group’s post read. As seen by Hackread.com, the claim was accompanied by an image allegedly showing a directory listing.\nViber, a messaging app introduced in 2010 and acquired by Japanese multinational firm Rakuten in 2014 for $900 million, has responded to the hackers’ claims.\nThe company has denied any evidence of intrusion into its systems or data compromise but confirmed that it has already launched an investigation to verify if a security breach has occurred. \nIf confirmed, this could be one of the largest data breaches in recent history. Experts opine that this breach, potentially involving personal messages, call logs, contact details, and financial information, can devastate Viber users. \nHandala Hack is a controversial group known for targeting Israeli entities and their allies to support the Palestinian cause. It has been active since establishing its Telegram channel in December 2023 and later joining Breach Forums.\nThis group claims to have targeted Israeli infrastructure, healthcare providers, community centers, tech companies, media outlets, and defence contractors with sophisticated techniques. \nSome of these techniques include phishing emails mimicking F5 BIG-IP zero-day security updates and SQL injection attacks, compromising databases and highlighting their intent to disrupt political messages through cyber means. Their claimed targets include Hadarom Port, Home Medics, Rosh Ha’ayin Municipal Society, and DRS RADA Technologies.\nWhether verified or not, the incident involving Viber raises questions about the app’s data security practices. Viber needs to address user concerns by clearly explaining the situation and any potential risks to user data. \nIn the meantime, Viber users should exercise caution and change their passwords, be cautious of phishing attempts, and stay informed about any updates regarding the alleged data breach by checking Viber’s official channels.\nUpdate: At 09:51 on Wednesday, March 20, 2024, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), a Viber spokesperson contacted Hackread.com and dismissed the claims made by “Handala Hack.”\nNew Red Ransomware Group (Red CryptoApp) Exposes Victims on Wall of Shame\nCybersecurity researchers at Netenrich have uncovered a new ransomware group called Red Ransomware Group (Red CryptoApp). This group operates differently from typical ransomware outfits, adding a twist to their extortion tactics.\nUnlike most ransomware groups that keep their operations under wraps, Red CryptoApp appears to be taking an aggressive approach. According to Netenrich, the group has established a “wall of shame” where they publish the names of companies they have successfully targeted. This tactic aims to humiliate victims and pressure them into paying the ransom to have their names removed.\nAlthough the origins of the Red CryptoApp ransomware are yet unknown based on the listing on its dark web leak site, it is believed that the group started their operation in February 2024. \nIt is also worth mentioning that, researchers have noted some similarities between one of the ransomware notes written by the group and the Maze ransomware gang in 2020. It could be a coincidence; therefore, it is unclear if Red Ransomware Group is a spinoff of the Maze gang which shut down its operation in November 2020.\nNetenrich’s blog post offers a technical breakdown of the Red CryptoApp ransomware. While specific details haven’t been widely shared to avoid giving attackers an advantage, the report indicates Red CryptoApp uses file encryption techniques to render a victim’s data inaccessible. In case, a targeted system is successfully compromised its files will add a .REDCryptoApp extension to them.\nA look at the Red CryptoApp ransomware gang’s wall of shame, the United States stands as the primary target with five victims in total, followed by various other countries including Denmark, India, Spain, Italy, Singapore, and Canada. \nAs for the targeted industries, the software and manufacturing sectors emerge as the most frequently targeted industries, with additional focus observed in education, construction, hospitality, and IT sectors.\nThe emergence of Red CryptoApp ransomware shows how this threat has evolved over the years. Organizations must be prepared to defend themselves against various attack methods. \nNetenrich emphasizes the importance of regular data backups, proper security practices, and user education on phishing attempts, which are a common entry point for ransomware attacks.\nFake Skype, Zoom, Google Meet Sites Infecting Devices with Multiple RATs\nZscaler’s ThreatLabz cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new scam where Remote Access Trojans (RATs) are distributed through online meeting platforms, targeting Android and Windows users with malware. The purpose is to distribute malware that can steal sensitive data and control infected devices.\nResearchers discovered a threat actor creating fraudulent websites for spreading malware, including SpyNote RAT for Android and NjRAT and DCRat for Windows, in December 2023. These RATs can steal confidential information and log keystrokes. Users are lured through fake online meeting sites impersonating brands like Skype, Google Meet, and Zoom. \nThe actor used shared web hosting, hosting all fake sites on a single IP address in Russian, and URLs that closely resembled the actual websites. The attackers distributed multiple malware families using these fake websites, posing a significant threat to innocent users.\nTo download the software, users must either click the Android or Windows buttons. When they click on Android, a malicious APK file gets downloaded, whereas clicking on the Windows button triggers the download of a BAT file, which automates tasks and performs additional actions, such as downloading a RAT payload.\nA campaign imitating legitimate online meeting platforms is a significant threat, with fake sites mimicking their appearance and functionality. In December, as noted by Zscaler in a blog post, a fake Skype site, join-skypeinfo, was created to trick users into downloading the application, leading to a BAT file and a WinRAR archive file. \nThe fake Google Meet site, online-cloudmeetingpro, was hosted on a subpath resembling a joining link. The fake Zoom sites have URLs with genuine Zoom meeting IDs that increase the risk of falling victim to the scam. \nThese fake websites also contained an open directory with NjRAT executable files, suggesting the attacker may use them in other campaigns. \nSuch campaigns can have devastating consequences. RATs can compromise devices, allowing attackers to steal sensitive information, monitor user activity, and potentially control the infected device. \nTo protect yourself, double-check URLs, verify meeting invitations, download software from official sources, and use antivirus and anti-malware software. Beware of fake websites, verify meeting invitations, and download applications from official sources.\nReport Uncovers Massive Sale of Compromised ChatGPT Credentials\nGroup-IB’s Threat Intelligence has released a “Hi-Tech Crime Trends 23\/24” report highlighting a dramatic surge in ransomware attacks, macOS system threats, and the growing use of AI by cyber criminals.\nThe report revealed Asia-Pacific being the primary target for advanced persistent threat groups in 2023, with 523 attacks worldwide. APAC organizations accounted for 34% of global attacks, with Europe and the Middle East ranking second and Africa third. \nA 70% rise in public ads selling zero-day exploits was recorded during 2022-2023. Threats like the CVE-2023-38831 zero-day vulnerability in ZIP file format remained popular among advanced cybercrime groups and nation-state actors for cyber-espionage activities. \nThe report also warned of a growing interest in AI systems, particularly ChatGPT credentials, for reaching sensitive corporate data as public Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not protect accounts with multi-factor authentication. \nAI systems can let attackers access confidential information, including internal source code, financial data, and trade secrets, and access communication history logs between employees and systems, allowing attackers access to sensitive data.\nOver 225,000 infostealer logs containing compromised ChatGPT credentials were detected between January-October 2023. Four ChatGPT-style tools were developed since mid-2023 to facilitate such activities, including WolfGPT, DarkBARD, FraudGPT, and WormGPT. FraudGPT and WormGPT are popular for social engineering and phishing, while WolfGPT focuses on code or exploits.\nResearchers detected around 130,000 compromised hosts with ChatGPT access between June and October 2023, marking a 36% increase from the previous year. The LummaC2 information stealer breached most logs. \nResearchers also detected 4,583 companies with their information, files, and data published on ransomware Distributed Leaks (DLSs), marking a 74% growth from the previous year, with North American companies being the biggest victims. \nGlobal threat actors, primarily APT groups, are targeting Apple platforms more, with underground sales of macOS information stealers increasing fivefold. Most concerning cyber risks for 2024 include zero-day exploits and malicious service use.\nCybersecurity firms have long been raising alarm over the continuous expansion in the global cyber threats spectrum. In June 2023, Group-IB researchers discovered a trend of over 100,000 devices infected with stolen ChatGPT credentials, with 26,802 compromised accounts recorded in May 2023. The Asia-Pacific region had the highest concentration of compromised credentials. ChatGPT’s default settings store user queries and AI responses, exposing confidential information.\nIn January 2024, Kaspersky Digital Footprint Intelligence reported threat actors exploiting AI technologies for illegal activities, sharing jailbreaks and exploiting legitimate tools for malicious purposes, particularly ChatGPT and LLMs, which can be used for malicious purposes, including malware development and illicit language model use.\nThe latest report highlights a significant rise in ransomware attacks targeting manufacturing, real estate, healthcare, government, and military sectors, the growing sophistication of cybercriminals targeting macOS systems, and the potential misuse of AI by cybercriminals to automate tasks, personalize attacks, and bypass security measures. \nBusinesses should invest in robust security solutions like firewalls, endpoint protection software, and intrusion detection systems, along with offering employee training on cyber threats to stay protected.\nCryptoChameleon Phishing Scam Targets Crypto Users and FCC Employees\nLookout has discovered a multi-pronged phishing campaign, dubbed “CryptoChameleon,” that mimics legitimate login pages for cryptocurrency platforms and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) via mobile devices. \nThe kit uses carbon copies of SSO pages and phishing via email, SMS, and voice to trick victims into sharing sensitive information, including usernames, passwords, password reset URLs, and photo IDs, mainly targeting US-based users. \nResearchers detected the suspicious phishing kit when they found a suspicious new domain registration, fcc-oktacom. The phishing kit targets cryptocurrency platforms and SSO services and can impersonate various company brands, with Coinbase being the most frequently targeted service. Researchers identified other websites using the kit, with most using a subdomain of official-servercom as their C2.\nThe attack as reported by Lookout in its blog post, has successfully phished over 100 victims, with many still active. Notable files in the kit include the C2 server URL, client-side logic, and style sheets. Cybercriminals use RetnNet hosting for most sites.\nVictims have to first complete a captcha using hCaptcha, which prevents automated analysis tools from identifying the site and creates a sense of credibility for the site. Once done, a login page mimicking the FCC’s official Okta page is launched, where victims enter their credentials and wait for a login or MFA token. \nThe attacker monitors this page via an administrative console and can select where to send the victim’s information. They try to log in using the victim’s credentials in real-time and redirect them to the appropriate page based on the requested information from the MFA service. \nThe phishing page could be customized by providing the victim’s phone number and choosing between a 6- or 7-digit code. The phishing kit targets cryptocurrency platforms and SSO services, impersonating various company brands, with Coinbase being the most frequently targeted service. \nAdditionally, victims are lured through phone calls, emails, and text messages, while phishing emails are disguised as legitimate messages from cryptocurrency platforms or the FCC containing malicious links, while SMS messages resemble legitimate notifications.\n Furthermore, Voice phishing involves impersonating representatives to trick victims into revealing confidential information over the phone. Most legitimate victim data came from iOS and Android devices, indicating the attack is primarily targeted at mobile devices. \nResearchers suspect that Scattered Spider could be behind this attack because Scattered Spire also impersonates Okta, registers domains using companyname-okta.com, and homoglyph swapping. However, the phishing kit has significantly different capabilities and C2 infrastructure.\nCryptoChameleon is a unique phishing campaign that targets multiple devices, mimics genuine login pages, and uses advanced techniques like hCaptcha to bypass detection tools and enhance the legitimacy of their websites, making them difficult to distinguish from legitimate ones.\nResearchers suggest users be cautious with unsolicited messages, verify the source of messages, and avoid sharing sensitive information online. Moreover, users must use strong, unique passwords, and stay informed on the latest phishing tactics and best practices for online security.\nFor insights, we reached out to Jason Soroko, Senior Vice President of Product at Sectigo, a Scottsdale, Arizona-based provider of comprehensive certificate lifecycle management (CLM) who stressed moving from traditional login and password and providing cybersecurity training and social engineering to employees.\n“Neither the usage of fake login screens nor lookalike domain names is novel, however, each of these techniques is effective in harvesting username and password credentials. What security teams should be doing is getting away from username and password authentication. If this isn’t possible, we have to go back to fundamental training in social engineering.”\n“We have been taught not to open attachments in emails that have specific characteristics, however, people also need to be taught to scrutinize the domains of websites they are entering credentials into. Ideally, we must get away from weak forms of authentication that can be harvested this way,” Jason advised.\nAndroid Money Transfer XHelper App Exposed as Money Laundering Network\nCloudSEK researchers have discovered XHelper, an Android app (not to be confused with the nasty XHelper malware) linked to a money laundering network, disguised as legitimate websites for scams like fake payment gateways and illegal gambling.\nIn October 2023, the CloudSEK Threat Intelligence (TI) team discovered a critical loophole in India’s banking infrastructure being exploited by Chinese threat actors in a “large-scale money laundering scheme targeting Indian citizens.” The scheme involved hundreds of thousands of compromised “money mule” accounts, transferring funds back to China.\nFor your information, money mules are individuals involved in fraudulent activities, transferring funds and executing financial crimes like cyber fraud or money laundering. \nNow, according to CloudSEK’s blog post, the XHelper app is distributed through websites designed as legitimate Money Transfer Businesses, while funds are converted into cryptocurrencies, and scammers are paid in USDT after deducting commissions. \nThe operation involves money mules activating order intake within the XHelper app, receiving\/fulfilling money laundering tasks, and executing illicit fund transfers using their linked bank app. Successful order completion results in financial rewards within the app, incentivizing continued participation. \nMoney mules are recruited by agents; they operate within a network through multiple Telegram channels. They prefer corporate bank accounts with higher transaction limits as it allows them to move large sums of money more efficiently. \nThe Xhelper app features a referral system, allowing agents to invite others and earn bonuses for successful recruitment. This pyramid-like structure amplifies the reach of illicit activities. It is a sophisticated app designed to facilitate money laundering across the globe, swiftly managing money mule schemes via deceptive payment systems. The app’s efficient operational framework allows criminals to scale their operations without specialized knowledge.\nFurthermore, the app integrates several unique features, including a mule ranking system, which allows cybercriminals to conduct their operations easily. XHelper optimizes recruitment and oversight of money mules, masking illegal fund origins and facilitating quicker transitions from bank accounts to cryptocurrency, hiding the paper trail of laundered money.\nThe XHelper app basically “serves as the technological backbone for fake payment gateways used in various scams, such as Pig Butchering, Task scams, Loan scams, E-Commerce scams, Illegal gambling apps, etc.,” CloudSEK researchers noted in the report. \nMoney mule activities can lead to financial losses and operational strain in banks, requiring additional security measures. Legal and compliance issues may result in fines and penalties. Enhanced transaction monitoring costs increase operational costs, and resource allocation is required for investigations, security measures, and compliance efforts. \nPrevention of such schemes is the only solution. for which financial institutions\/banks must enhance security, implement stricter verification protocols for merchant account opening, bolster net-banking security measures with multi-factor authentication, monitor suspicious activity, and educate users on secure practices.\nSavvy Seahorse Using Fake ChatGPT, Facebook Ads in DNS Investment Scam\nCalifornia-based IT automation and security company Infoblox has discovered a relatively new DNS threat actor called “Savvy Seahorse.” According to the company’s report, the actor creates fake investment platforms using popular icons like Tesla, Meta, and Imperial Oil and lures unsuspecting users into depositing funds. \nSavvy Seahorse prefers using Facebook ads to trick users into trusting fake investment platforms and transfers deposits to Russian-state-owned banks. Savvy Seahorse employs advanced techniques like fake ChatGPT and WhatsApp bots to lure users into high-return investment scams, which are the costliest category of threat reported to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center.\nChatGPT and WhatsApp bots engage users through automated responses for high-return investment opportunities. These campaigns target users in various countries, including Russian, Polish, Italian, German, Czech, Turkish, French, Spanish, and English speakers but interestingly users in Ukraine are protected. \nThrough DNS canonical name (CNAME) records, the actor creates a traffic distribution system (TDS) for conducting sophisticated financial scams, controlling access to content and updating the IP addresses of malicious campaigns. This also helps them evade detection by the security industry. It is worth noting that Savvy Seahorse, active since 2021, is the first publicly reported threat actor abusing DNS CNAME records for sophisticated scam campaigns.\nIn a blog post, Infoblox researchers have identified several red flags associated with the Savvy Seahorse scam. These include short-lived campaigns (active for only 5-10 days), using a phased deployment system, frequent changes in IP addresses (to complicate\/block tracking of malicious infrastructure), and the use of wildcard DNS entries. \nThese entries entail creating numerous subdomains, potentially confusing passive DNS analysis. These characteristics make it difficult to track and block malicious infrastructure. Victims’ data is sent to a secondary HTTP-based TDS server for validation and geofencing.\nAround 4.2k base domains with CNAME records are used by Savvy Seahorse to host campaigns, Infoblox researchers confirmed. The attackers create subdomains for each SLD using a domain generation algorithm, using pseudo-random hostnames. Registration forms are used to gather victim information, and after validating it, they are redirected to the fake trading platform. The actor monitors users to prevent security threats.\nThe scam poses potential risks to individuals, including financial loss, data theft, and malware infection. Users who invest in the fake platform may lose their funds, while the scammers may steal personal and financial information. \nTherefore, consumers must be vigilant when trusting unverified sources for making deposits. Remember that the US cumulatively lost over $4.6 billion in 2023 over investment scams.\nLockBit Ransomware Gang Returns, Taunts FBI and Vows Data Leaks\nThe leader of the LockBit ransomware, whose identity is still unknown to authorities, admitted negligence in letting the FBI and the UK’s National Crime Agency control its servers via a PHP attack but promised backups and continued operations.\nThe announcement comes only a week after the group was neutralized in Operation Cronos, a multinational law enforcement investigation, reportedly neutralized the ransomware gang.\nFor your information, on 19 February 2024, as reported by Hackread.com, law enforcement authorities seized LockBit’s infrastructure, including 34 servers that hosted the gang’s data leak website storing stolen data, cryptocurrency addresses, decryption keys, and the affiliate panel causing a major setback to the notorious gang.\nThe message from the gang’s admin which directly addressed the FBI and the NCA, revealed that servers without PHP installed in backup blogs are unaffected and will continue to release stolen data from targeted companies, even after the FBI hack, and stolen data will be published on the LockBit blog.\nThe admin claims that Operation Cronos was successful because of their negligence and irresponsibility in “not updating PHP settings on their servers in good time.” They denied Operation Cronos investigators’ claims regarding arresting their two alleged affiliates, the gang donating to a Crimea-based Russian propagandist (Sevastapol Colonel Cassad), and recovering a high number of decryptors. \nHowever, LockBit confirmed the FBI’s claim that its annual income exceeds $100m, based on data from seized cryptocurrency wallets during Operation Cronos. The group has deleted chats containing evidence of ransomware payments, indicating that their revenues exceed US law enforcement estimates. This demonstrates their success despite making mistakes.\nThe admin wrote that their victim’s admin chat panels server and blog server were running PHP 8.1.2 and were likely hacked using the CVE-2023-3824 vulnerability. LockBit ransomware has updated its PHP server and offering rewards for finding vulnerabilities in its latest version. LockBit has moved its data leak site to a new.onion address and has targeted five victims with countdown timers to expose the stolen data.\nRegarding why the FBI hacked their infrastructure, the gang stated that their ransomware attack on Fulton County in January irked the authorities for posing the risk of leaking information on Donald Trump court cases and other “interesting things.”\nLockBit claims authorities collected over 1,000 decryption keys during Operation Cronos from “unprotected decryptors,” which they defined as low-level malware builds. LockBit plans to upgrade security, manually release decryptors, host affiliate panels on multiple servers, and provide partners with access to different copies.\nDeepfake Threat: $2 Deceptive Content Undermines Election Integrity\nIn its latest report, cybersecurity researchers at Check Point Research team highlighted the dangers posed by the widespread availability of artificial intelligence-based technologies, particularly deepfake, in encouraging electoral fraud.\nResearchers cited deepfake technology as a significant threat to the authenticity of the electoral process due to features like voice cloning that can manipulate voters and sabotage the entire process. The technology is cheap, accessible to anyone with an internet connection, and untraceable, which hinders election security given the ongoing challenges in legislating against these technologies.\nDeepfake technology allows users to create “fabricated audiovisual content,” which poses a threat to public opinion and democratic institutions, researchers noted. With over 3,000 repositories on GitHub and hundreds of channels on Telegram (at least 400-500), deepfake services range from automated bots to personalized services. Pricing varies from $2 per video to $100 for multiple attempts, making it affordable to commission deceptive content.\nRecent incidents of damage caused by deepfake technology highlight its growing threat. In February 2024, an Asian company fell victim to scammers who impersonated the company’s CFO during an online meeting, resulting in a loss of over $25 million.\nOn platforms like YouTube, deepfake technology is being exploited by scammers to perpetrate crypto scams. Verified channels have been targeted to steal millions of dollars worth of crypto, with deepfakes of prominent figures such as Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Michael J. Saylor, and others being used to deceive unsuspecting viewers.\nIn June 2023, deepfake technology was utilized to disseminate fabricated video messages from President Putin. Similarly, in 2022, a deepfake video of Ukrainian President Zelensky went viral, urging Ukrainians to surrender.\nDespite efforts to combat deepfakes, such as the launch of McAfee’s tool MockingBird, which boasts a 90% accuracy rate in detecting malicious content, the potential damage from deepfake technology remains considerable and, in many cases, irreversible.\n“The potential for election fraud through the adept use of artificial intelligence and deepfake technologies, orchestrated by a clandestine network operating from the shadows, leaving no digital fingerprints” Check Point Research Team wrote in the blog post published on 22 February 2024.\nResearchers noted that an underground network of actors can manipulate public perception and undermine democratic integrity through deepfakes. The anonymity of this technology makes it difficult to hold anyone accountable. Traditional cybersecurity measures are insufficient as the threat lies in the entire ecosystem of deception it enables, including bots, fake accounts, and anonymized services.\nVoice cloning, a subset of deepfake technology that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to replicate a person’s voice with remarkable accuracy, is particularly effective in spreading misinformation. It allows the creation of convincing fake audio clips and is particularly effective in spreading misinformation, as incidents involving robocalls with fabricated messages from political leaders have already been observed. \nFor instance, a robocall featuring fake US President Joe Biden voice warning New Hampshire voters not to cast their ballots would cost from $10 to several hundred dollars depending on the level of accuracy and technological efficacy required.\nTo protect democratic processes from deepfakes, a multifaceted approach involving legislative measures, public awareness, technological solutions, and international cooperation is needed, including enhanced digital literacy and collaboration between technology companies and law enforcement, researchers concluded.\nApple Approves Fake App Before Real Rabby Wallet, Users’ Funds Stolen\nA fake version of the Rabby Wallet app, a popular crypto wallet developed by DeBank Global Pte Ltd., was tricking users and stealing their funds on the Apple App Store. DeBank’s team confirmed that any app available on the store currently is fake, as its official app is still under review and yet to be approved by Apple.\nFor your information, Rabby Wallet’s mobile app’s beta version was announced on 16 February by team DeBank. However, scammers acted quickly and uploaded the app’s fake version to the iOS App Store, which was a wallet drainer and had no connection with the real app.\nInterestingly, this fake version was approved by Apple before the actual wallet app, prompting users to download the drainer and get scammed.\nThe fake Rabby Wallet app, created by a developer called “Solution Development,” appeared on the App Store under the name “Rabby Wallet & Crypto Solution” and was detected after four days. A thread warning others about the fake app was posted on Rabby Wallet’s Apple discussion board and Discord channel with screenshots from scammed users.\nAffected users have also created a thread on Reddit to warn others about the fake app. One user claimed that a fake app by “VIET LONG FINANCIAL INVESTMENT JOINT STOCK COMPANY” has been approved, causing users to lose cryptocurrencies, with a user losing around 14 ETH.\n“This scammer’s approved AppStore App called “Rabby Wallet & Crypto Solution” is tricking people into thinking it is the genuine one, they enter the seed phrase or private key, and moments later all of their life savings, crypto belongings are GONE!” a user u\/CryptoCurrency wrote on Reddit.\nRabby Wallet team posted a statement on X to notify users about the presence of a fake app and to avoid downloading it. The fake app has now been removed by Apple.\nHowever, this isn’t the first instance where fake apps appeared on a credible platform like the Apple App Store and deceived users. On February 7, 2024, Hackread.com published a warning from LastPass, urging users to avoid downloading fraudulent applications and remain cautious after a fake app was uploaded to the Apple App Store, posing as the legitimate LastPass Password Manager app. The app was developed by Parvati Patel and closely resembled LastPass’ branding and user interface.\nIn July 2023, Apple approved a fake THREADS app, which subsequently ranked first on the European Apple Store, despite the original app being launched by META just days before and wasn’t available in Europe. Nevertheless, such incidents are steadily rising, making Apple’s app review and approval process doubtful and questionable.\nNCA’s LockBit Takedown: Source Code, Arrests and Recovery Tool Revealed\nIn a groundbreaking operation, the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA) has dismantled the notorious LockBit ransomware, one of the world’s most prolific ransomware groups – The takedown was part of “Operation Cronos.”\nOn 19 February 2024, Hackread.com’s in-depth report revealed that all dark web domains of LockBit ransomware had been seized. Now, according to the NCA’s press release, the latest development in this ongoing saga sees the agency taking control of LockBit’s primary administration environment, effectively cutting off the group’s ability to carry out further attacks. \nAdditionally, the agency has seized control of LockBit’s public-facing leak site on the dark web, repurposing it to expose the group’s tactics and operations.\nCrucially, the NCA has obtained the source code of the LockBit platform and a wealth of intelligence on the group’s activities and affiliates. This trove of information not only sheds light on LockBit’s modus operandi but also provides insight into the individuals and organizations complicit in their criminal enterprises.\nOne noteworthy disclosure from the NCA’s investigation is the discovery that some of the data on LockBit’s systems belonged to victims who had already paid ransom demands. This highlights the harsh reality that even compliance with ransom demands does not guarantee the safe return of stolen data—a fact often glossed over by cybercriminals.\nThe crackdown on LockBit extends beyond digital infiltration, with law enforcement agencies in multiple countries executing arrests and freezing cryptocurrency accounts linked to the group. \nIn a coordinated effort led by Europol, two LockBit actors from Poland and Ukraine have been apprehended, while the US Department of Justice has brought criminal charges against two Russian nationals Artur Sungatov and Ivan Kondratyev, alias Bassterlord, for deploying LockBit against multiple victims across the United States. \nThese victims include businesses spanning various industries nationwide, such as manufacturing, alongside global victims in sectors like semiconductors.\nIt is worth noting that in June 2023, Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov (20), a Russian national, was also arrested and charged with conspiring to commit LockBit ransomware attacks against U.S. and foreign businesses. To date, the LockBit ransomware gang targeted over 2,000 victims and received more than $120 million in ransom payments.\nIt is also crucial to mention that the FBI has established an online platform for victims of LockBit ransomware. This platform caters to both U.S. victims and non-U.S. victims interested in engaging with the U.S. LockBit prosecutions. Whether it’s to submit a victim-impact statement or to claim restitution, individuals can access the platform here: Lockbitvictims.ic3.gov.\nThe Japanese Police, with support from Europol, has developed a specialized recovery tool aimed at restoring files encrypted by the LockBit 3.0 Black Ransomware. To utilize this recovery solution effectively, users are instructed to execute the provided binary file on their affected machines, initiating an initial assessment process.\nThe tool will be available on the No More Ransomware platform soon. Alternatively, if you are a victim and based in the United Kingdom send an email to the NCA at [email protected]. Those in the United States can visit Lockbitvictims.ic3.gov.\nThe NCA’s Director General, Graeme Biggar, hailed the operation as a testament to the agency’s relentless pursuit of cybercriminals, emphasizing that no criminal enterprise is beyond its reach. Home Secretary James Cleverly echoed this sentiment, commending the NCA for disrupting LockBit’s operations and signalling the UK’s unwavering commitment to combatting cyber threats.\nUS Attorney General Merrick B. Garland emphasized the collaborative nature of the operation, highlighting the partnership between US and UK law enforcement agencies in dismantling LockBit’s criminal infrastructure. FBI Director Christopher A. Wray echoed these sentiments, underscoring the bureau’s dedication to defending against cyber threats and holding perpetrators accountable.\n\nThe NCA reveals details of an international disruption campaign targeting the world’s most harmful cyber crime group, Lockbit.Watch our video and read on to learn more about Lockbit and why this is a huge step in our collective fight against cyber crime. pic.twitter.com\/m00VFWkR9Z\nFor insights into the latest development, we reached out to Ryan McConechy, CTO of Barrier Networks, who expressed appreciation for law enforcement’s role in combating cybercrime, particularly the escalating threat of ransomware.\n“These actions demonstrate the efforts law enforcement is placing on fighting ransomware, but the seizure of LockBit’s servers is undoubtedly one of the biggest accomplishments so far.”\nRyan warned that seizing infrastructure and arrests does not mean the gang can not return. However, strengthening your cybersecurity measures can defend businesses against such threats. \n“Organisations must act before it is too late,” he emphasised. “This involves training on threats, implementing MFA to secure employee credentials, keeping systems up to date with patches, and getting a well-oiled and comprehensive incident response plan in place, so everyone can step straight into effective action, even when attacks do occur,” Ryan advised.\nAs the dust settles on this major takedown, the NCA and its international partners stand ready to assist LockBit victims in recovering encrypted data and pursuing justice. With LockBit now effectively locked out, the NCA remains alert, knowing that the group may attempt to regroup and rebuild its criminal empire. \nHowever, with the combined efforts of law enforcement agencies worldwide, the message to cybercriminals is clear: there is no safe haven for those who seek to profit from extortion and cybercrime.\nLockBit Ransomware Gang Domains Seized in Global Operation\nLaw enforcement authorities have seized the official and all known dark web websites of the LockBit ransomware gang as part of “Operation Cronos.” The latest development appears to have occurred earlier today, although there has been no confirmation or press release issued by authorities at this time.\nHowever, as observed by Hackread.com, .Onion domains owned by the group now display a seizure notice announcing its takeover by the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Crime Agency in cooperation with the US Department of Justice, the FBI, Europol, and other entities.\nIt’s important to note that the notice itself contains details about the incident. Authorities have revealed that this is an ongoing and developing operation conducted under the banner of “Operation Cronos.”\nDoes this suggest that more ransomware gangs will face the wrath of law enforcement agencies? Have arrests been made, and has electronic and monetary infrastructure been seized? For answers, we must wait until tomorrow, as authorities have urged visitors to visit seized LockBit domains at 11:30 GMT on Tuesday, February 20th, for more information about the operation.\nAdditionally, LockBit affiliates attempting to log into the affiliate panel have also encountered a surprising message, providing a glimpse of what has been accessed and seized by authorities.\nHere is the list of all dark web domains that display seizure notice:\nIt is worth noting that the exact origin of the group is unknown, but the US government believes the cybercrime syndicate operates from Russia. In June 2023, Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov (20), a Russian national, was arrested and charged with conspiring to commit LockBit ransomware attacks against U.S. and foreign businesses.\nProbably not. While we await official confirmation from law enforcement agencies, it’s quite likely that no arrests have been made, allowing the group to potentially continue operating under its existing guise or rebrand itself with a new identity. Furthermore, it remains unclear if authorities have successfully seized the group’s cryptocurrency wallets, which likely contain significant sums gained from ransomware payments.\nLockBit ransomware emerged as a significant threat, targeting both large and mid-sized organizations across various sectors, including healthcare, education, government, and critical infrastructure. Some of the group’s notable claimed targets included the following:\nThe group utilizes multiple techniques to infiltrate victim networks, such as phishing emails, exploiting vulnerabilities, and purchasing stolen credentials on the dark web. Once inside, LockBit encrypts critical data, making it inaccessible to the victim, and demands a ransom payment in exchange for a decryption tool. If the ransom is not paid, they threaten to leak stolen data online through their dark web portal. \nLockBit has released several versions of their ransomware, notably LockBit 2.0 and LockBit 3.0. The impact of LockBit attacks extends beyond financial losses, including disruption to operations, data recovery costs, reputational damage, and privacy concerns due to data leaks, which expose sensitive information and pose risks such as identity theft and fraud.\nFor insights into this, we reached out to William Wright, CEO of Closed Door Security, who sees no surprise in the event due to the extent of LockBit’s targets over the years.”\n“LockBit is the most prolific ransomware gang to ever have existed and it was responsible for devastating attacks on hundreds of businesses, including the Royal Mail, which cost the organisation millions to recover from, so it’s not surprising the UK’s NCA wanted to feature so heavily in this disruption.”\n“It could be said that LockBit was largely responsible for the growth of the ransomware industry today,” William explained. “Its affiliates saw big financial returns from the attacks, which undoubtedly made ransomware the attack-of-choice for many criminals and drew others to the industry.”\nWilliam also warned of LockBit’s potential return, which could be more aggressive than before. Therefore, companies must exercise precautions. “The attackers could resurface under new branding as we have seen with DarkSide to BlackMatter to BlackCat, and many others. Enterprises must therefore continue to protect their networks against ransomware. While law enforcement is making good progress, the battle is not over yet.”\nThis is a developing story, with official confirmation from law enforcement authorities pending. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and update this article accordingly.\nHundreds of Indians Rescued from Cambodian Cybercrime Gangs\nIndian authorities have successfully rescued hundreds of citizens who were lured to Cambodia with false promises of legitimate jobs, only to be forced into working for cybercrime gangs. This news comes after a period of growing concern about human trafficking targeting Indian nationals in Southeast Asia.\nThe details of the rescue operation remain undisclosed, but a statement from India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) confirmed the success. The MEA spokesperson, Shri Randhir Jaiswal, acknowledged that the ministry, along with the Indian embassy in Cambodia, had previously issued warnings regarding such dangers. However, Jaiswal added that many Indian nationals unfortunately remain trapped in the Southeast Asian country.\nThe rescued individuals were reportedly tricked into travelling to Cambodia under the false pretence of high-paying jobs. Once there, their passports were confiscated, and they were forced to work long hours conducting cybercrime activities for the gangs. These activities likely involved scams like telecom fraud, where victims are tricked into revealing personal information or sending money.\nThis incident shows the growing problem of human trafficking for cybercrime purposes. In December 2023, a global law enforcement operation codenamed “Storm Makers II” led to the arrest of hundreds of individuals suspected of human trafficking, cybercrime, and other offences. The operation revealed cases involving victims from various countries, including Malaysia, Uganda, and India.\nThe operation spanned numerous cyber scams, including the case of 40 Malaysians who were enticed to travel to Peru with promises of lucrative employment, as well as several individuals recruited for jobs in Dubai, only to be redirected to Thailand and Myanmar.\nIt’s also important to mention that last month’s INTERPOL Financial Fraud report highlighted human trafficking as a significant contributor to worldwide cybercrime. The organization pointed to the harmful deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other technologies as a key reason for the increase.\nThe Indian government’s efforts to rescue its citizens highlight the regional nature of this issue. Cambodia, along with other Southeast Asian nations, has become a hotspot for cybercrime activity due to factors like lax regulations and unprotected borders.\nWhile the successful rescue is a positive development, the Indian government faces the challenge of repatriating the remaining trapped individuals. Additionally, raising awareness about such scams and improving international cooperation to tackle human trafficking networks are necessary steps to prevent future incidents.\n1 in 5 Youth Engage in Cybercrime, NCA Finds\nA recent report by the National Crime Agency (NCA) has revealed a disturbing trend: one in five children aged 10-16 in the UK have engaged in online activities that violate the Computer Misuse Act. This raises serious concerns about the increasing prevalence of cybercrime among young people and stresses the urgent need for greater awareness and education.\nThe report, based on a comprehensive survey, highlights several concerning online behaviours, including:\nThe NCA emphasizes that many children may unknowingly engage in these activities, unaware of the legal implications and potential consequences. This underlines the critical need for open communication between parents, educators, and children about online safety and responsible behaviour.\nThe report also stresses the importance of proactive education and awareness campaigns targeted at both children and adults. Educating young people about cybercrime, its various forms, and the legal ramifications associated with it can significantly deter them from engaging in risky online behaviour.\nFurthermore, the NCA advocates for promoting positive alternatives to encourage children to engage in safe and productive online activities. This can involve fostering their interest in educational resources, creative pursuits, and responsible online communities.\nWhile the report paints a concerning picture, it is crucial to remember that not all online activity by children is illegal. It is essential to distinguish between harmless exploration and deliberate malicious intent based on the specific details and context surrounding each case.\nThe NCA’s report should be a wake-up call, urging parents, educators, and policymakers to work collaboratively to address the growing issue of cybercrime among young people. By fostering open communication, promoting education and awareness, and encouraging responsible online behaviour, we can create a safer and more positive digital environment for future generations.\nEditor’s Note: We must have open and honest conversations with young people about their online activities. We need to educate them about the potential risks and consequences of their actions and equip them with the knowledge and skills to navigate the online world safely and responsibly.\nDuo Jailed for Hacking JFK Taxi Dispatch System\nTwo men from Queens, New York, were sentenced to prison today for their roles in a scheme to hack the electronic taxi dispatch system at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). Daniel Abayev, 47, received a four-year sentence, while Peter Leyman, 49, received two years. Both were convicted of conspiring to commit computer intrusion.\nThe scheme, as reported by Hackread.com, involved Abayev and Leyman working with Russian hackers to manipulate the taxi queue, allowing participating drivers to jump ahead of the line for a fee. This not only disrupted the fair and orderly flow of taxi services at JFK Airport but also impacted the livelihood of honest taxi professionals who followed the rules.\n“This was not just a technical crime; it was an attack on the integrity of a critical system and a betrayal of the trust placed in these individuals,” stated U.S. Attorney General Damian Williams. “Their actions caused real harm to honest taxi drivers and undermined the public’s confidence in the fairness of the system.”\nAccording to the investigation, Abayev and Leyman conspired with the Russian hackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the dispatch system. This allowed them to remotely manipulate the queue, placing taxis driven by participants at the front of the line regardless of their arrival time. \nThe scheme reportedly facilitated up to 1,000 expedited trips per day, generating over $100,000 in illegal income for the perpetrators. The scheme started in September 2019 and continued until September 2021. \nThe judge presiding over the case, Paul A. Crotty, emphasized the seriousness of the offence, stating, “Hacking is just another way of stealing. This was done persistently over an extended period of time.”\nIn addition to the prison sentences, Abayev and Leyman were ordered to pay substantial restitution ($3,456,169.50) and forfeiture ($161,858.26) amounts. They are also subject to supervised release upon their release from prison.\nThis case goes on to show the potential consequences of cybercrime, particularly its impact on critical infrastructure and the livelihoods of ordinary people. It also highlights the importance of strong cybersecurity measures and vigilance in protecting sensitive systems from malicious actors.\nUS Takes Down Notorious Warzone RAT Malware Operation, Arrests 2\nIn a major blow to cybercrime, the US Department of Justice, along with international partners and private companies, has dismantled the infrastructure behind the infamous Warzone RAT malware. Two individuals believed to be key players in the operation have also been arrested, while the website used in the operation has been seized as well.\nWarzone RAT, short for Remote Access Trojan, was a powerful and versatile tool used by cybercriminals to gain complete control over infected devices since 2018.\nThis malware granted attackers access to steal sensitive data like passwords and financial information, spy on victims through webcams and microphones, lock them out of their devices for ransom, and even launch further attacks. Its widespread use and sophisticated capabilities made it a major threat to individuals and organizations alike.\nOn February 9, 2024, the US Department of Justice announced a coordinated effort involving the FBI, international law enforcement agencies, and private cybersecurity firms that successfully dismantled the Warzone RAT infrastructure. This action effectively crippled the malware’s distribution and operation, significantly disrupting cybercriminal activities relying on it.\nAs part of the operation, two individuals were arrested and charged with their involvement in the Warzone RAT scheme. One suspect, residing in Malta, was accused of managing the malware distribution network. The other, based in Nigeria, was allegedly responsible for developing and maintaining the malware itself. Both face serious charges related to computer fraud and abuse.\nThe takedown of Warzone RAT represents a significant victory for law enforcement and cybersecurity experts. It demonstrates the effectiveness of collaboration between international partners and the private sector in combating large-scale cybercrime. While this specific threat has been neutralized, it serves as a reminder that the fight against cybercrime is an ongoing battle.\nThe specific details of the investigation and technical aspects of the operation that dismantled Warzone RAT remain undisclosed for security reasons. The disruption of Warzone RAT is expected to have a ripple effect on other cybercriminal activities that relied on this tool. Continued collaboration and attention from law enforcement and cybersecurity experts are essential to combat evolving cyber threats.\nWhile the dismantling of Warzone RAT is encouraging, it’s crucial to remain alert against growing cyber threats. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself:\nQR Code Scam: Fake Voicemails Target Users, 1000 Attacks in 14 Days\nResearchers at Check Point Harmony Email have discovered a surge in cyberattacks involving fake voicemails. According to the company’s report shared with Hackread.com, cybercriminals are exploiting corporate phone systems’ links to email servers, embedding malicious links in voicemail playbacks for credential harvesting.\nScammers are increasingly using voicemail as a lure to trick users into clicking on malicious links one of which is creating legitimate-looking voicemails. Since corporate phone systems are tied to email, scammers are using this to include a voicemail recording hyperlinked to a malicious page. In this case, 1,000 attacks have been reported during the last two weeks.\nWhat happens in this attack is that through social engineering, scammers send QR codes with conditional routing based on the device, targeting any end-user. The email analyzed by Check Point researchers appeared to be sent by payment processor service Square. However, in reality, the name was only used to mislead users. \nMoreover, the email’s subject line contained a phone number, which was illegitimate when searched on Google. The email also includes an embedded MP3 player, containing the voicemail. It redirects users to a credential harvesting page when clicked.\nThis attack relies on user participation. Any successful phishing attack requires user input, except for zero-click attacks. Users must replay, click on links, or enter information for the attack to progress. This allows scammers to experiment with creative options, such as impersonating a reputable brand and using voicemails. They observe user behaviour and adjust their attacks accordingly, ensuring a successful phishing attack.\nHackread has been reporting a rise in the trend of combining voice and phishing, aka Vishing to trap unsuspecting users into giving away sensitive data. We earlier reported Check Point researchers identifying a vishing campaign targeting users in South Korea with a new Android malware, dubbed “FakeCalls.” Cybercriminals tricked users into sharing sensitive financial information through fake calls supposedly made by legitimate financial organizations. This is part of a growing global threat to mobile banking customers, using sophisticated social engineering techniques to make calls seem legitimate.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, email security firm IronScales discovered around 100,000 new phishing campaigns targeting companies using PBX telephone systems for communication and information sharing. These scams, targeting working-from-home employees from various sectors like engineering, real estate, IT, oil & gas, healthcare, financial services, and IT, involved voicemail email phishing.\nVishing, or voice phishing, involves using telephones to trick users into disclosing financial and personal information, such as account numbers and passwords. Fraudsters may claim compromised accounts, represent banks or law enforcement, or offer software installation assistance. Protecting yourself involves knowledge, hanging up if asked for personal information, and calling a reliable source. Security professionals can implement AI-based security, check and emulate all URLs, and use multiple layers of protection.\nOver 800 Phony “Temu” Domains Lure Shoppers into Credential Theft\nTemu is the latest brand chosen by scammers for their phishing scams. Checkpoint’s Harmony Email’s cybersecurity researcher Jeremy Fuchs, has noted that hackers are using Temu’s giveaway rewards to entice users to give away their credentials, with over 800 new domains registered as “Temu” in the last three months.\nFor your information, Temu is an international e-commerce store having 40% of its user base in the USA. It offers discounted goods shipped directly to consumers. Temu was launched in 2022 and is available in 48 countries, including Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Australia. \nAs of February 7, 2024, it is the number one shopping app on Google Play Store and second on the Apple App Store. The app’s most frequent shoppers are senior citizens, mostly 59 and above. \nThe sample phishing email identified by researchers claims to be from Temu Rewards. However, if you look closely, it is sent by an unrelated email address- onmicrosoft.com. The email contains a blank image and a link to a credential harvesting page. The threat actors try to attract recipients by informing them that they have won.\nAccording to Checkpoint’s blog post, the email has Temu’s name as the sender. However, if the user realizes the sender address isn’t related to Temu or the links don’t lead to a Temu page, they’ll stay away from this scam. The email should raise suspicion as it is sent from a generic address on onmicrosoft (.) com, and the image does not load.\nThis isn’t the first time threat actors have exploited brand names and the latest trends to steal credentials or other sensitive information from innocent users.\nIn November 2022, Hackread reported that Cyjax researchers discovered a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting over 400 brands across various sectors. The scammers, likely having Chinese affiliations, used 42,000 domains to distribute malware and generate ad revenue with at least 24,000 survey\/landing domains used to promote the scam.\nCybersecurity researchers at Bloster AI recently discovered a USPS Delivery phishing campaign utilizing advanced techniques to target victims in the US. Bolster’s CheckPhish detected over 3,000 phishing domains mimicking Walmart. The campaign tricked consumers into thinking they had failed deliveries and late payments. Threat actors have improved their attack tactics, transitioning from deceptive messages to luring victims into downloading financial or banking data-stealing apps.\nA phishing scam targeting Meta Platforms, Inc. business owners to steal their email addresses and passwords, leading to the takeover of their Facebook page, profile, and financial information was discovered in January 2024. The scam used Meta Platforms’ authority to create urgency and legitimacy.\nTemu itself has faced several cybersecurity-related issues, including allegations of collecting user and device data such as text messages and banking information.\nIn November 2023, a class-action lawsuit was filed in the United States, alleging that the company had unlawfully collected its customers’ data.  Furthermore, another report surfaced, implicating Temu in the unauthorized disclosure of customer data, particularly in connection with data purportedly appearing for sale on the dark web after customers make purchases through the app.\nNevertheless, it’s crucial to emphasize basic security measures with users and ensure that all threats can be stopped, both simple and sophisticated, especially scams like these, which exploit users’ trust in big brands. \nAdditionally, to protect against phishing attacks, security professionals must implement AI-based security, robust URL protection, and full-suite security to scan documents and files.\nFake LastPass Password Manager App Lurks on iOS App Store\nAttention, LastPass users! A cunning imposter has infiltrated the iOS App Store, posing as the legitimate LastPass Password Manager app. This fake app, aptly named “LassPass Password Manager,” seeks to deceive users and potentially steal their sensitive login credentials.\nDespite slight alterations to the logo and name, the fake LastPass app operates seamlessly to scam unsuspecting users into downloading it, as its colour scheme and font closely mimic those of the original LastPass app.\nIt all began on February 7, 2024, when LastPass published a blog post warning unsuspecting users to remain vigilant and avoid downloading a fraudulent application. Despite LastPass’s report, the app remains available on the App Store and is developed by an individual using the name Parvati Patel. Interestingly, the developer also has another app on their account, a community service app for India, hinting at their location.\nJust to clarify, the LastPass password manager app is owned by GoTo, formerly known as LogMeIn Inc. Therefore, the official app lists LogMeIn Inc., as its developer on the Apple App Store.\nThe fake app can be seen here, while the authentic one can be downloaded from here.\nNevertheless, this isn’t the first instance of a fake app mimicking a popular developer making its way onto the Apple App Store. In July 2023, Apple approved a fake THREADS app, which later surged to number 1 on the Apple Store in Europe. Interestingly, the original THREADS app had been launched by META just a few days prior to the incident and was not yet available in Europe when the fake one appeared in the store.\nThe Anatomy of Trading Bot Scams: Strategies for Secure Investments\nIn the fast-paced world of fintech, automation promises convenience and profitability. Trading bots, algorithms programmed to execute trades based on predefined rules, are increasingly popular. However, within this exciting industry lurk malicious actors peddling trading bot scams, designed to exploit the hopes and naiveté of aspiring investors.\nThis article digs into the anatomy of these scams, equipping you with the knowledge to protect your hard-earned capital and make informed investment decisions.\nWith the advancement of technology and the availability of high-speed internet, trading bots, while focusing on price action, have become increasingly popular among both retail and institutional traders. These bots are designed to execute trades automatically based on pre-defined criteria without the need for human intervention. The primary goal is to remove emotions from trading, as emotions can often lead to impulsive and irrational decisions.\nGuaranteed Returns: Any investment promising consistent, risk-free returns is a red flag. Markets are inherently volatile, and no technology can guarantee profits. Be wary of claims like “double your money in a week” or “never lose a trade.”\nUnrealistic Performance: Testimonials boasting astronomical returns or screenshots of fabricated charts are classic tactics. Remember, past performance is not indicative of future results.\nHidden Fees: Scammers often obfuscate fees and charges within complex terms and conditions. Scrutinize every cost associated with the bot, including subscription fees, performance-based commissions, and withdrawal charges.\nLimited Transparency: Beware of bots with unclear trading strategies, proprietary algorithms, or lack of historical backtesting data. Reputable bots provide detailed explanations of their approach and demonstrate past performance with verifiable data.\nPressure and Urgency: Scammers employ pressure tactics to rush you into decisions. Phrases like “limited-time offer” or “act now before spots fill up” are warning signs. Take your time to research and understand the bot before investing.\nUnsolicited Contact: If someone reaches out to you unsolicited, promising high returns from a trading bot, be extremely cautious. Legitimate financial services rarely resort to cold calling or aggressive online marketing.\nFake Reviews and Endorsements: Online reviews and celebrity endorsements can be easily fabricated. Verify the authenticity of such claims before trusting them.\nWhile the aforementioned scams target victims’ funds, malicious threat actors are also known for using malware disguised as fake trading bots to steal personal data. For instance, Fortinet researchers identified a fake Bitcoin trading bot that targeted users’ Bitcoin and personal data simultaneously.\nEducate Yourself: Before dipping your toes into the bot world, gain a solid understanding of financial markets, trading strategies, and the potential risks involved.\nDo Your Research: Don’t blindly trust marketing hype. Conduct thorough research on the bot, its developers, and any associated platforms. Look for independent reviews, user testimonials (with a healthy dose of scepticism), and regulatory compliance.\nStart Small: If you decide to proceed, invest a small, manageable amount initially. This minimizes potential losses and allows you to test the bot’s effectiveness before committing larger sums.\nNever Grant Full Access: Avoid bots requiring access to your entire investment portfolio or exchange accounts. Opt for bots that integrate with reputable platforms and allow you to maintain control over your funds.\nDiversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your investments across different assets and platforms to mitigate risk.\nManage Expectations: Remember, the financial market is not a get-rich-quick scheme. Expect realistic returns and be prepared for potential losses.\nReport Suspicious Activity: If you encounter a scam, report it to the relevant regulatory authorities and online platforms to help protect others.\nUtilize Reputable Platforms: Trade only on licensed and regulated exchanges or platforms with robust security measures and user protection protocols.\nEnable Two-Factor Authentication: Add an extra layer of security to your accounts with two-factor authentication to prevent unauthorized access.\nBeware of Phishing Scams: Be wary of emails, messages, or websites mimicking legitimate platforms trying to steal your login credentials. Always double-check URLs and sender information before entering sensitive details.\nStay Informed: Keep yourself updated with the latest financial news, scams, and regulatory changes to stay ahead of potential threats.\nCryptocurrency investments are lucrative but also risky. By understanding the anatomy of trading bot scams and adopting secure investment practices, you can navigate this complex world with confidence and protect your hard-earned capital. Remember, caution is key – educate yourself, research thoroughly, and never be afraid to walk away from anything that seems too good to be true.\nDisclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

According to Resecurity, the stolen login credentials being sold are a result of infostealing malware infecting PCs to harvest sensitive information. \nThis parallels a similar incident in June 2023, where hackers were found selling 100,000 ChatGPT login accounts. These accounts were obtained through devices infected with Raccoon, Vidar, and Redline malware worldwide.\nAccording to Resecurity’s blog post, researchers have identified a threat actor operating under the alias “Jobaaaaa,” who has been observed selling 18,317 compromised AnyDesk accounts. These accounts are being offered for sale for $15,000 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) or Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency, with transactions facilitated through escrow services.\nHowever, Alon Gal of Hudson Rock has countered Resecurity’s findings, stating that the threat actor is actually selling over 30,000 AnyDesk accounts. Despite this difference, the use of Escrow—a trusted third-party payment service—by the hacker adds a level of credibility to the offer.\nThese compromised AnyDesk accounts are being marketed on Exploitin, a cybercrime and hacker forum accessible on both the clear and dark web and primarily operating in Russian. This forum has gained notoriety for facilitating various cybercrimes, including exploiting vulnerabilities, selling databases, and leaking sensitive information. \nInterestingly, it’s the same platform where administrators of the Genesis cybercrime market acknowledged the seizure of their clear web domain in April 2023.\nResecurity’s latest revelation centers on the timestamps related to the sale of compromised accounts. The timestamps visible on the shared screenshots illustrate instances of successful unauthorized access on February 3, 2024, after the disclosure of the security incident.\nFurthermore, researchers have verified that the compromised accounts include those of both individual users and enterprises. This highlights the potential for a significant disaster for organizations and unsuspecting users if these accounts fall into the wrong hands. As a precautionary measure, it is crucial for all AnyDesk users, irrespective of their location, to promptly change their passwords.\nThe potential impact, whether on an individual or enterprise, would be devastating. Here’s what could happen if a functioning AnyDesk account for either an individual or an enterprise falls into the hands of a malicious threat actor:\nHere are some steps that individuals and enterprises can take to protect themselves:\nNevertheless, regardless of your location or whether you recently changed your AnyDesk account password, it’s critical to change the password once again immediately.

His partner, Sarah Jamal Muhammad Al-Sayyid, allegedly aided in establishing EHF and procured web servers to host ISIS platforms.\nThe Treasury Department accuses EHF of playing a crucial role in bolstering ISIS’s online presence and financial networks. Their alleged activities include:\nThe Treasury Department’s sanctions freeze any assets Salim and Al-Sayyid hold in the United States and prohibit US citizens and businesses from engaging in financial or commercial transactions with them. Additionally, a $20,000 reward (PDF) is offered for information leading to their arrest or conviction.\nAccording to Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E., these measures aim to disrupt ISIS’s financial operations, including the use of cryptocurrency, and prevent the group from leveraging its online presence for recruitment and propaganda purposes.\nThis announcement can be a significant development in disrupting ISIS’s online activities. Cybercrime and anonymous fundraising are vital to the group’s operations, and these sanctions aim to cripple their financial and technological support networks.\nNotably, this isn’t the first US action against ISIS’s online presence. In August 2020, the United States claimed to have disrupted three cryptocurrency campaigns run by terror groups, including the Al-Qassam Brigades (the military wing of Hamas), Al-Qaeda, and ISIS.\nFBI Warns of Tech Support Courier Scam Aiming at Cash and Metals\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) has released a Public Service Announcement (PSA), warning that users are being tricked into handing over their funds for safekeeping, often in the form of cash or metals in a new kind of scam that blends online and offline methods. \nThe IC3 reported $5 million in losses from May to December 2023, attributed to scammers posing as tech support or US government officials to gain users’ trust.\nThe IC3 states that scammers can also use multiple identities to trick victims into believing their financial accounts are at risk, instructing them to liquidate their assets or purchase precious metals. The scam combines on-and-offline techniques to obtain victims’ hard-earned money, with some victims wired directly to a metal dealer.\nThis malicious scheme starts with threat actors\/scammers convincing victims, typically senior citizens, that their bank accounts have either been hacked or could be targeted by cybercriminals. This generates a sense of urgency.\nAccording to the alert, after convincing the victim to get the cash or precious metals, the scammers send couriers to collect it from them, claiming they will safeguard them in a protected account. However, victims never receive a response and lose their money. To make this exchange seem legitimate, scammers can share a passcode with the victims.\nSuch scams are becoming increasingly widespread and law enforcement agencies keep warning users about them. A recent trend noticed in this regard is the incorporation of unorthodox and novel ways of deception to install malware or steal funds, indicating that scammers are expanding their deception boundaries substantially.\nFor instance, in July 2023, the Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Division reported that US military personnel were receiving unsolicited smartwatches, which could connect to Wi-Fi networks and establish unauthorized connections with their cell phones, potentially exposing sensitive personal data. In its press release, the department noted that the devices contained malicious software, including malware, which allowed the sender to access saved data, including banking information, contacts, and account details. \nAnother innovative attack was identified by Trustwave SpiderLabs in March 2020. In this unique attack, a compromised USB dongle was used to target businesses. The FBI issued a warning, stating that Fin7 is the cybercrime syndicate behind this notorious scheme involving infected USB devices.\nTo avoid becoming victims of such scams, the FBI advises the public to protect personal information, avoid handing over cash or metals to strangers, avoid clicking on pop-ups, unsolicited messages, or downloading software, and never allow unknown individuals to access their computers.\n“The US Government and legitimate businesses will never request you purchase gold or other precious metals,” the FBI noted.\nNew iMessage Phishing Campaign Targets Postal Service Users Globally\nA new report by cybersecurity firm Netcraft has discovered a sophisticated phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform called “Darcula.” This platform is being used to launch large-scale smishing attacks targeting the United States Postal Service (USPS) and global postal services across more than 100 countries.\nDarcula represents a significant development in the world of cybercrime. Unlike traditional PhaaS platforms that rely on email communication, Darcula leverages iMessage and Rich Communication Services (RCS) messaging for its attacks. This allows cybercriminals to bypass SMS firewalls commonly used to block phishing attempts.\niMessage and RCS offer features like file transfers and enhanced media support, making them appear more legitimate than traditional SMS messages. Additionally, these messaging services are often used for personal communication, potentially lowering a user’s guard against potential phishing attempts.\nThe Darcula platform facilitates smishing attacks, a form of phishing that uses text messages to trick victims. These messages often impersonate legitimate organizations, such as postal services, and typically lure users into clicking malicious links or providing sensitive information.\nIn the case of attacks targeting postal services, the messages might impersonate the USPS or a similar national postal service, informing recipients of missed deliveries or requesting additional information for package clearance. Clicking the malicious link could lead to a fake website designed to steal the user’s login credentials, credit card information, or other sensitive data.\nThe Netcraft report reveals that Darcula has been operational for at least a year and has been used in attacks on users in the UK and the United States. The platform’s capacity to target postal services in over 100 countries highlights its global reach and the potential impact of these phishing campaigns.\nWhile the use of iMessage and RCS introduces a new element to smishing attacks, basic security principles and training remain crucial in protecting oneself. Users should be wary of unsolicited messages, even those coming from seemingly familiar sources. \nPhishing attempts often create a sense of urgency, urging users to click links or respond immediately. Taking a moment to verify the legitimacy of a message by contacting the sender directly through a verified phone number or website can help avoid falling victim to these scams.\nAccording to Max Gannon, Cyber Intelligence Analysis Manager at Cofense, “Darcula, a very advanced phishing kit, paints a dire picture of phone-based phishing that individuals are not trained to avoid. This kit uses new techniques carefully designed to avoid security controls.“ \n“While this advanced phishing kit is problematic and avoids common security controls, a user trained properly to detect phishing emails should be just as likely to detect phishing messages on other platforms,“ Max emphasised.\n“The existence of this kit emphasizes the importance of training individuals to be more vigilant across platforms. Even if a trained individual were to fall for the phishing attempt and click the link, the request for sensitive information like credit card details or SSNs should raise immediate concerns,“ he added.\nDark Web Drug Lord Pleads Guilty, Forfeits $150M Cryptocurrency\nIn a significant blow to the clandestine world of dark web drug trafficking, an Indian national, Banmeet Singh, pleaded guilty to orchestrating a large-scale operation that spanned continents, marketing a range of controlled substances. \nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Singh’s admission of guilt today, revealing shocking details of a lucrative enterprise that fueled addiction and crime across the globe.\nSingh, a 40-year-old from Haldwani, India, emerged as a key figure in the dark web underworld, leveraging platforms like Silk Road, Hansa and Alpha Bay to market and distribute a cocktail of drugs, including fentanyl, LSD, ecstasy, and others. Customers looking for drugs used cryptocurrency to buy them from Singh’s online shops.\nThe Justice Department’s Acting Assistant Attorney General, Nicole M. Argentieri, emphasized the significance of Singh’s guilty plea, which includes the forfeiture of an eye-popping $150 million in cryptocurrency. “Today’s guilty plea… demonstrates that the Justice Department will hold criminals who violate U.S. law accountable no matter how they conceal their activity,” Argentieri stated in a press release.\nAccording to court documents, Singh’s operation spanned from at least mid-2012 to July 2017, with distribution cells peppered throughout the United States and beyond. From Ohio to Florida, Maryland to North Dakota, the tentacles of Singh’s network reached far and wide, shipping drugs to locations in all 50 states, Canada, Europe, and the Caribbean.\nAdministrator Anne Milgram of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) hailed the collaborative effort that dismantled Singh’s empire, highlighting the cooperation between U.S. and U.K. law enforcement agencies. “DEA is proud to have worked with its law enforcement partners… to protect the American people and bring Singh to justice,” Milgram remarked.\nSingh’s arrest in London, England on 26 April 2019 by the National Crime Agency (NCA), marked a crucial turning point in the investigation, leading to his extradition to the United States on 19 March 2023. \nWith Singh’s admission of guilt, the dance of deception orchestrated by his organization has come to a halt, signalling a victory for justice and a stark warning to would-be traffickers lurking in the shadows of the dark web. As the sentencing date looms, authorities remain vigilant, determined to safeguard communities against the scourge of drug trafficking.\nThis case, led by groups like the DEA and IRS, shows how important it is for countries to work together to stop crime that crosses borders. Whether it’s in Ohio or London, cops are fighting to stop dark web drug dealers and keep everyone safe.\nThousands of Dark Web Posts Expose ChatGPT Abuse Plans\nThe internet’s underbelly, the Dark Web, has evolved from being a hub for stolen data and illicit transactions to a breeding ground for developing AI-powered cybercrime tools, reports Kaspersky Digital Footprint Intelligence service. \nThe findings are based on Kaspersky’s observation of Dark Web forum discussions throughout 2023. AI (Artificial intelligence) technologies are being exploited for illegal activities, with threat actors sharing jailbreaks via dark web channels and exploiting legitimate tools for malicious purposes. \nIn September 2023, Hackread reported SlashNext researchers discovering threat actors promoting successful jailbreaks on AI chatbots and writing phishing emails. These actors are selling jailbroken versions of popular AI tools.\nParticularly notable is cybercriminals’ preference for ChatGPT and Large Language Model (LLM), which simplifies tasks and increases information accessibility, but poses new security risks as cybercriminals can use them for malicious purposes.\nThreat actors are exploring schemes to implement ChatGPT and AI, including malware development and illicit use of language models, explained Kaspersky digital footprint analyst Alisa Kulishenko.\nCybersecurity threats like FraudGPT and malicious chatbots were recurring topics on Dark Web forum discussions, with nearly 3,000 posts observed throughout the year, peaking in March 2023. Stolen ChatGPT accounts are also a popular topic, with advertisements surpassing 3,000 ads. \nBetween January and December 2023, according to Kaspersky’s report, cybercrime forums regularly featured discussions on using ChatGPT for illegal activities. One post was about how to use GPT to generate polymorphic malware, which is harder to detect and analyze than regular malware. \nAnother post suggested using the OpenAI API to generate code with specific functionality while bypassing security checks. While no malware has been detected using this method, it is possible. \nChatGPT-generated answers can solve tasks that previously required expertise, lowering entry thresholds into various fields, including criminal ones, by providing a single prompt for processing specific string formats. AI is incorporated in malware for self-optimization, with viruses learning from user behaviour to adapt attacks. \nAI-powered bots are creating personalized phishing emails, manipulating users to reveal sensitive information. Cybercriminals are also using deepfakes, where AI is used to create hyper-realistic simulations, impersonate celebrities\/personalities, or manipulate financial transactions, fooling unsuspecting users easily.\nMoreover, researchers noted that cybercriminal forums integrate ChatGPT-like tools for standard tasks, with threat actors using jailbreaks to unlock additional functionalities. In 2023, 249 offers for selling these prompt sets were discovered. \nOpen-source tools for obfuscating PowerShell code are shared for research, but their easy accessibility can attract cyber criminals. Projects like WormGPT and FraudGPT raise concerns and developers warn against scams and phishing pages offering access to these tools.\nThis poses a significant challenge for cybersecurity experts and law enforcement agencies, as traditional detection methods become useless against AI-powered threats. New strategies and tools must be developed to combat this threat. \nInvesting in AI-powered security solutions, being cautious when opening suspicious emails, links, and attachments, and staying informed about the latest trends in cybercrime and AI is mandatory.\nQR Code Phishing Soars 587%: Users Falling Victim to Social Engineering Scams\nCheck Point Software Technologies, a cybersecurity solutions provider, has published new research illustrating a typical QR code attack. In this attack, scammers utilize QR codes to redirect users to a credential harvesting page, adjusting the redirection chain based on the user’s device.\nThe goal is to install malware and steal credentials. Check Point’s Live Cyber Threat Map identified 20,000 instances of QR code attacks within two weeks, highlighting the vulnerability of QR codes to cyber criminals. \nHackread.com previously reported that Check Point Research noticed a whopping 587% increase in QR-code-based phishing attacks between August and September 2023. This could be attributed to the lack of QR code protection in email security solutions and the widespread use of scanning QR codes. \nSecurity vendors worked to develop new protections, but threat actors responded with a new variation of QR code attacks. Recently Bitdefender observed a rise in YouTube stream-jacking campaigns using deepfake videos for cryptocurrency theft. YouTube stream-jacking is a cybercrime where criminals steal accounts using livestream pop-ups, QR codes, and malicious links. \nIn October 2023, SlashNext reported a rise in QR-code-based phishing attacks using Quishing and QRLJacking. Quishing involves circulating a QR code with malware download links on various platforms, redirecting users to phishing websites or downloading malware.\nIt happens because QR codes have several layers of obfuscation, including the QR code itself, a blind redirect to another domain, and an anti-reverse engineering payload. These layers can be used to redirect users to suspicious activities or fake login pages. Hackers can increase their success rate by navigating conditional redirection.\nAttacks sending QR codes with conditional redirection, using social engineering techniques and BEC 3.0. Check Point researchers provide multiple examples of how these phishing attempts will look like. In one such instance, users are requested for an annual 401K contribution statement by scanning the QR code. \n“The QR code has a conditional destination point based on browser, device, screen size, and more,” directed to different pages depending on these parameters, Check Point Research noted in their report shared with Hackread.com.\nUsers’ device type affects the display of links though, as Mac users see one link, while Android users see another. However, the result will be the same. Nevertheless, these attacks highlight the convincing nature of phishing attempts and the importance of multi-layered cybersecurity in preventing the consequences of such attacks. \nTypically, default security layers will let go if the first redirect is clean. However, a complete security solution can prevent these attacks by blocking multiple layers. This includes email security, browser security, mobile security, anti-malware, and post-delivery security. These layers work together to block suspicious behaviour, inspect websites, and decode QR code attacks. \nHowever, since such attacks are difficult to detect or thwart due to multiple obfuscation layers, security professionals need AI-based security, the ability to decode QR code attacks, and multiple layers of protection. By implementing these best practices, security professionals can substantially prevent phishing attacks and protect their systems.\nBreachForums Admin Pompompurin Gets 20-Year Supervised Sentence\nConor Brian Fitzpatrick, a 21-year-old man from Peekskill, New York, has been sentenced to 20 years of supervised release in the Eastern District of Virginia for operating the notorious BreachForums hacking forum.\nFor your information, Fitzpatrick launched BreachForums in March 2022 after the FBI took down the then-popular cybercrime marketplace, RaidForums. It served as an ideal platform for selling\/leaking millions of personal data worldwide. The platform contained nearly 900 stolen databases storing more than 14 billion individual records, which BreachForums members were entitled to use. \nBreachForums ceased operations after the FBI apprehended Fitzpatrick and reportedly reemerged under the management of ShinyHunters, causing concern among cybersecurity experts and law enforcement agencies worldwide. Baphomet, one of the original forum administrators, confirmed the resurgence in a PGP-signed message, leaving little doubt about its authenticity.\nFitzpatrick was arrested on 15th March 2023 from his family home. Under custody, he admitted to owning\/operating BreachForums under the “pompompurin” moniker. The accused was released on a $300,000 bond and was re-arrested on 2nd January 2024 for violating pretrial release conditions by using a computer without the required monitoring software and using VPN services.\nFitzpatrick was charged in March 2023 for stealing and selling sensitive personal data of countless US citizens and US and foreign organizations and government agencies via the forum. Court documents reveal that he possessed nearly 26 video files containing sexually explicit videos of minors, including prepubescent ones. Prosecutors claimed Fitzpatrick knowingly possessed these files.\nThe sentencing recommendation memo reveals several incidents involving Fitzpatrick, including a data leak in December 2022 exposing records of 87,760 members of InfraGuard, 200 million users of a US social media company, 20 million user records for a background check service company, and data theft involving thousands of users’ private health insurance information in March 2023.\nFitzpatrick pleaded guilty to several counts, including Conspiracy to Commit Access Device Fraud, Solicitation for the Purpose of Offering Access, and Possession of CSAM on July 13, 2023 (PDF). He served as a middleman for stolen data transactions and admitted to feeding false information to law enforcement.\nProsecutors sought 188 months (15.7 years) of imprisonment. The defendant’s attorneys filed a memo under seal recommending his sentencing, citing confidential and medical information that should not be disclosed to the public. The court showed leniency and sentenced Fitzpatrick to time served and 20 years of supervised release. The sentencing memorandum was submitted (PDF) on 16th January 2024.\nPer the sentencing conditions (PDF), for the first two years of his release, Fitzpatrick will stay at home arrest with a GPS locator and also receive mental health treatment. Fitzpatrick cannot access the internet during his first year of supervised release, and a probation officer will install monitoring software on his computer.\nProsecutors claimed that Fitzpatrick’s platform enabled hackers and fraudsters to commit “more sophisticated crimes than any could have done alone,” impacting nearly every sector of U.S. society.\nIran’s Mint Sandstorm APT Hits Universities with Hamas-Israel Phishing Scam\nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence has reported that Iran-linked threat actors, including Mint Sandstorm (APT35 and Charming Kitten), are targeting high-profile researchers working on the Israel-Hamas conflict through phishing scam led by a sophisticated social engineering campaign.\nThe campaign aims to gather diverse perspectives on the conflict by targeting those working at universities and research organizations. Mint Sandstorm, a subset of Iran‘s intelligence arm, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), specializes in compromising sensitive information from high-value targets through resource-intensive social engineering campaigns.\nAccording to Microsoft’s research, a subset of Mint Sandstorm, PHOSPHORUS, has been targeting high-profile individuals working on Middle Eastern affairs at researchers associated with academic research organizations and universities in the UK, USA, Belgium, France, Gaza, and Israel since November 2023.\nMicrosoft has observed new tactics in this Mint Sandstorm campaign, including using compromised email accounts to send phishing lures, connecting to its C2 server using the Client for URL (curl) command and delivering a custom backdoor called MediaPl.\nThe threat actor uses spoofed email addresses to impersonate journalists and send benign emails asking for their review or feedback on an article on the Israel-Hamas war. They used legitimate but compromised email accounts belonging to the individuals they seek to impersonate. \nIf someone falls for the lure, Mint Sandstorm sends another email containing links to malicious domains that lead them to sites like cloud-document-editonrendercom to retrieve a RAR archive file supposedly containing the draft document.\nThe.rar file is decompressed into a double extension file (.pdf.lnk) and launches a curl command to retrieve malicious files from attacker-controlled subdomains of glitchme and supabaseco. \nMicrosoft observed multiple files downloaded to targets’ devices in this campaign, including several.vbs scripts and a renamed version of NirCmd. The attacker uses a malicious file, Persistence.vbs, to persist in compromised environments.\nThe campaign may have further bolstered Mint Sandstorm’s credibility and contributed to its success. The tradecraft involves impersonating known individuals, using bespoke phishing lures, and benign messages in the initial stages.\nResearch indicates that Mint Sandstorm is continually improving and modifying its tools to target desired environments, potentially allowing it to maintain persistence and evade detection. \nMicrosoft recommends implementing mitigations to reduce the impact of Mint Sandstorm campaigns. This involves training end-users against clicking URLs in unsolicited messages, and disclosing\/sharing their credentials, as well as checking for poor spelling and grammar in phishing emails and spoofed app names.\nMicrosoft also encourages users to use web browsers that support SmartScreen to identify\/block malicious websites and scams. Also, enable network protection to block connections to malicious domains and IP addresses. Cloud-delivered protection can cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques.\nFor insights, we reached out to Balazs Greksza, a Threat Response Lead at Ontinue. “Actors like APT35 have primary goals around geopolitics, national security, and counter-intelligence and in tense situations military preparedness and in the general understanding of economic and trade practices; however sanctioned countries have a more difficult time to influence.,” said Balazs. \n“Actors like APT35 have primary goals around geopolitics, national security, and counter-intelligence. In tense situations military preparedness and in a general understanding of economic and trade practices; however, sanctioned countries have a more difficult time influence,” Balazs explained.\nYouTube Crypto Con: Scammers Rake in $600K with Deepfakes and QR Codes\nCybersecurity researchers at Bitdefender have published their latest research, highlighting a growing trend of YouTube stream-jacking campaigns using deepfake videos for cryptocurrency theft. The latest report continues the company’s research on YouTube-related malicious scams published in October 2023.\nDespite companies like McAfee launching tools such as MockingBird, designed to detect 90% of deepfake content, scammers persist in employing malicious techniques to execute crypto scams. In some instances, they have managed to successfully bypass facial recognition systems, highlighting the ongoing challenges in combating these deceptive practices.\nFor your information, YouTube stream-jacking is a cybercrime where criminals steal accounts from popular channels using livestream pop-ups, QR codes, and malicious links. Crypto-doubling scams lure viewers into depositing their cryptocurrency into platforms, promising quick returns. Victims are lured into depositing their funds, only to find their funds disappear without a trace.\nAs of the first week of January 2024, there were 2.70 billion active users on YouTube. These staggering stats make the video hosting platform a lucrative target for cybercriminals and scammers. \nAccording to Bitdefender’s research, cybercriminals are enhancing their stream-jacking attacks by creating content that mimics legitimate cryptocurrency news or announcements. \nStream-jacking 2.0 scams target popular channels for account takeover or lure followers to mimic channels with rewards. During their research, the researchers discovered that the top three highjacked accounts to carry these scams have over 31 million subscribers, with Tesla, MicroStrategy, and SpaceX being the top brands used. Bitdefender estimates that cyber criminals have netted over $600K so far.\nBitdefender’s blog post suggests that scammers use multiple announcements and high-profile news headlines to make their scams appear credible. For instance, attackers used the “SpaceX Starship integrated flight test 2” official event to launch fake livestreams under “SpaceX Launch Starship Flight Test! Elon Musk gives update on Starship!” on compromised channels.\nDeepfake content helps scammers spread fraudulent schemes on compromised channels, using cryptocurrency-related videos of famous personalities, popular conference talks, and recordings. They encourage viewers to scan a QR code and send a certain amount of crypto to be doubled. Some deep fakes are of decent quality, but the live chat section is disabled unless a selected member or subscriber has been a long-term subscriber.\nThere is also a rising trend of using Deepfakes in YouTube ads rather than livestreams, providing more opportunities for cybercriminals to spread scams. Account takeovers are usually enabled by compromising YouTube access tokens with stealers.\nMalicious actors revamp the channel to impersonate the entity they want to impersonate, likely through automated processes. The revamping process involves changes to the channel name, handle, visibility, avatar, banner, description, links, featured channels, and anything that can help identify the original channel.\nBitdefender researchers have identified signs of artificial boosting of viewers in most livestreams. In December 2023, malicious actors began broadcasting scams targeting the Bitcoin ETF, focusing on MicroStrategy and Michael Saylor. \nOne such example is scammers broadcasting using looped deepfakes relying on MicroStrategy’s former CEO to participate in giveaways by scanning QR codes and following instructions. Compromised channels use variations of the official MicroStrategy logo, official banners, and playlists to boost credibility.\nThe most common names after the takeover are MicroStrategy US, MicroStrategy, Microstrategy, Microstrategy US, Microstrategy Live, and Micro Strategy. Subsequently, deceptive websites began to surface, hosted on domains mimicking the company’s name or its former CEO, often incorporating symbols associated with cryptocurrencies and multipliers. \nThese fraudulent sites featured animated presentations showcasing multiple transactions, designed to create the illusion of live activity. It’s important to note that these animations were randomly generated and did not reflect actual transactions, serving as a misleading tactic to convey a false sense of legitimacy.\nCrypto scams on YouTube are a serious issue. In 2020, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak sued YouTube over Bitcoin scams using his name. Wozniak accused YouTube and Google of enabling Bitcoin giveaway scams by failing to take action against them.\nTo avoid becoming a victim of stream-Jacking 2.0, be cautious of unexpected changes in content, double-check links, avoid investing based on online endorsements, and thoroughly research investment opportunities. \nAdditionally, Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on YouTube accounts to prevent unauthorized access. Remember that if something seems too good to be true, it could be a scam. Don’t let a deepfake fool you into losing your crypto.\nNew Phishing Scam Hooks META Businesses with Trademark Threats\nIn a recent wave of cybersecurity threats, scammers have unleashed a sophisticated phishing scam targeting META business owners on Facebook. Perpetrators are sending deceptive messages claiming trademark rights infringements, posing a severe risk to unsuspecting page owners.\nA concerning phishing scam has emerged, specifically targeting business owners associated with Meta Platforms, Inc. Scammers are exploiting fears of trademark rights infringements, attempting to force page owners into clicking on malicious links under the guise of resolving alleged policy violations. \nIn reality, the scam is aimed at stealing the email address and password of the Facebook account further leading to the takeover of the page, profile and financial information.\nThe fraudulent message, seemingly originating from a supposed temporary support agent, warns recipients of an impending permanent deletion of their Facebook page. The scam leverages the authority of Meta Platforms, Inc., formerly Facebook, to create an atmosphere of urgency and legitimacy.\nIn normal circumstances, scammers and two-bit thieves create phishing pages which are full of coding errors, spelling and grammar mistakes. Additionally, their design lacks sophistication and often turns out to be broken pages.\nHowever, the ongoing phishing scam is quite sophisticated only and only because of its flawless design. A look at the screenshot captured by Hackread.com shows scammers have become professional in coding and web design:\nThe phishing scam involves collecting personal data, including full names, email addresses, phone numbers, and dates of birth. It deceives victims by prompting them to file an appeal, but before doing so, they are asked to sign in to their accounts. Once signed in, the scammers siphon off their email and password.\nIn the next stage of the scam, victims are requested to provide additional Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for supposed verification, such as an ID card, passport, or driver’s license. However, uploading these documents leads nowhere; it is merely a gimmick to keep the victims busy. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the scammers attempt to change the passwords of the victims’ email addresses and Facebook accounts.\nThe scam relies on the victim’s anxiety about losing their Facebook page and business reputation. By including an official-looking Meta Platforms, Inc. copyright notice and a seemingly authentic support ID, scammers aim to lend credibility to their fraudulent message.\nThis isn’t the first instance of Meta business owners falling victim to a phishing scam. In October 2023, Vietnamese hackers were reported to have employed DarkGate malware targeting META accounts in India, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nTo safeguard against falling victim to this phishing scam, business owners are urged to:\nAs cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, caution is crucial. META business owners and Facebook page administrators are advised to stay informed about potential scams and report any suspicious activity to the platform’s official channels.\nStay tuned for updates on cybersecurity measures and protect your online presence against emerging threats.

Ltd. has revealed shocking details on Inferno Drainer, a phishing operation targeting cryptocurrency wallet providers. The scam, involving the deployment of a multichain crypto drainer, operated under a scam-as-a-service model, targeted over 100 brands and 16,000 malicious domains, stealing over $80 million in digital assets from November 2022 to November 2023. It ceased operating in November 2023 after causing significant financial damage.\nThe Inferno Drainer team is “estimated to have reaped over $87 million in illicit profits by scamming over 137,000 victims,” Group-IB’s blog post read.\nResearchers discovered over 14,000 phishing websites with malicious scripts impersonating Seaport, WalletConnect, and Coinbase protocols, with over 5,500 spoofed and 550 scripted. The scammers’ Telegram channel description only mentions @Mr_inferno_Drainer, supposedly its developer and tech support provider, whereas the team’s first public mention was on the day the channel was created, on November 5, 2022.\nInferno Drainer team used high-quality phishing pages to lure unsuspecting users to their websites. They targeted victims via social media platforms like X, Telegram, and Discord, offering free tokens called airdrops and rewards for minting nonfungible tokens. Google-owned Mandiant’s X account was also compromised, distributing links to a phishing page hosting a cryptocurrency drainer called CLINKSINK. \nGroup-IB analyzed 500 domains and found a JavaScript-based drainer hosted by a user “kuzdaz” on a GitHub repository. Another set of 350 sites was found on a different repository.\nThese sites lured victims to connect their wallets for potential riches while the malicious scripts were designed to complete unauthorized transactions. The scam operators claimed a flat rate of 20% of stolen assets, while affiliates retained 80% of their gains. They spoofed Web3 protocols (including Seaport, WalletConnect, and Coinbase) under DApps to initiate malicious transactions.\nFor affiliates, it offered a customer panel to customize malware features and detailed statistics, including the number of victims connecting to their wallets on each phishing website, the number of confirmed transactions, and the stolen assets’ value. \nGroup-IB’s High-Tech Crime Investigation Department’s Andrey Kolmakov stated that despite the group’s claim to shut down its operations in November, this control panel remained active throughout December, allowing other hackers to exploit the situation.\n“Inferno Drainer may have ceased its activity, but its prominence throughout 2023 highlights the severe risks to cryptocurrency holders as drainers continue to develop further,” Kolmakov noted.\nUnravelling Retirement Banking Scams and How To Protect Yourself\nIn the labyrinth of financial scams, one of the most insidious is the retirement banking scam. Imagine a lifetime of diligence and effort, only to be robbed in your golden years. According to the FBI, in 2020 alone, financial scams targeting seniors netted more than $1 billion. This grim reality affects countless unsuspecting retirees, demonstrating the urgency to learn how to protect ourselves.\nIt’s a quiet crisis that we need to address, and understanding these scams is the first step toward safeguarding our financial future. Let’s begin this journey to empowerment, where knowledge is our most potent defence.\nRetirement crypto and banking scams are not random acts but carefully crafted strategies that exploit vulnerabilities. Typically, these scams involve manipulating trust, inciting fear, or promising high investment returns. As we delve deeper, we’ll explore the common tactics scammers utilize, the red flags to watch out for, and the preventive measures you can take.\nRetirement banking scams refer to fraudulent acts that aim to deceive retirees, leading to the loss of their hard-earned savings. Scammers prey on retirees, exploiting their lack of familiarity with the intricate financial landscape or utilizing their trust in seemingly legitimate institutions.\nThese scams may materialize in various forms, such as bogus investment opportunities, fake lottery winnings, or even imposter relatives in need.\nAwareness and vigilance are critical to debunk these deceptions. As we proceed, let’s examine the most common types of these scams, spot their tell-tale signs, and delve into practical preventive measures.\nHere are some common techniques scammers may use against you:\nPhishing is a common scamming technique prevalent in the digital sphere. It’s characterized by deceptive emails or text messages sent by scammers masquerading as trustworthy entities.\nThe primary purpose is to trick unsuspecting victims into disclosing sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or Social Security numbers. These messages often contain seemingly urgent requests or threats, compelling the recipient to act immediately.\nIt’s essential to stay vigilant against such attempts by not clicking on suspicious links or sharing personal information via unsecured platforms.\nThe pension advance scam is a deceptive scheme where retirees are offered an immediate cash advance in exchange for future pension payments.\nThis proposal may seem attractive to those in financial need but often includes exorbitant interest rates and fees.\nConsequently, retirees pay significantly more than the initial advance, depleting their retirement funds prematurely. Awareness and caution are vital when dealing with offers that seem too good to be true.\nBogus investment opportunities represent fraudulent schemes designed to dupe people into separating them from their hard-earned money. Scammers craft convincing narratives around high-return, low-risk investment opportunities. They use persuasive language and seemingly credible documentation to appear legitimate.\nHowever, these investments are non-existent or grossly misrepresented, leaving the investors with significant financial losses once the scam is revealed. The best defence is scepticism and due diligence before investing.\nFake charity scams targeting retirees exploit the kind-heartedness of senior citizens. Scammers pose as charity workers, requesting donations for fabricated causes. They employ emotional narratives to elicit sympathy and manipulate their targets into giving money. Often, these scams occur during disaster relief scenarios, where the urgency and desire to help are high. The best protection is thorough research before donating to any charity.\nProtecting oneself from scams requires vigilance and proactive measures. Here are straightforward and effective ways you can protect yourself:\nScammers incessantly devise cunning strategies to exploit the vulnerability of others, particularly retirees. Understanding their tactics is paramount for self-protection.\nThe following sections delve into how scammers identify their targets, the psychological ploys they use, and practical strategies to safeguard themselves.

Contrary to their intended use, these badges are typically reserved for high-profile individuals and businesses. \nThese badges, displayed alongside the familiar blue and grey ticks, enhance visibility and provide exclusive features. The cost to obtain a gold verification badge is $1,000 per month in the U.S. Unfortunately, this exclusivity also makes these accounts lucrative and prime targets for cybercriminals.\nThe paper, authored by Rishika Desai, discusses the unauthorized acquisition of Twitter Gold accounts, risks like phishing and disinformation campaigns, and the need for strong cybersecurity practices.\nCloudSEK researchers discovered a rise in sales of Twitter Gold accounts with verification on dark web forums and marketplaces. These ads are traced back to online shops and their marketing partners, with most detected using Google Dork. \nIn a particular case, a compromised Twitter Gold account had its primary domain set as abc.com. The latest post was published in 2019. Afterwards, in 2022, a new post emerged, creating a clear link to the purchase of gold from cybercriminals occurring after 2019. \nThe new post directed users to an alternate domain, ‘ABC.XYZ,’ established just two months ago. Investigation into the passive DNS resolution by CloudSEK suggested the account can spread disinformation, phishing websites, job scams, and crypto scams. These accounts can also be redirected to malware or embedded Trojans.\nAdditionally, researchers discovered accounts with a gold tick mark subscribed, posting links to malicious domains. The price distributions varied based on the type of account, with fresh homegrown accounts costing $0.30, blue tick accounts costing $35, older accounts costing $1.5, and converted accounts costing $1200-$2000. Blue and gold affiliates cost $150 and $500 per account, respectively.\nThreat actors offer 15 inactive accounts per week for conversion into gold subscriptions, resulting in over 720 accounts annually, with sales ranging from USD 1200 to USD 2000 and gold badges ranging from USD 1200 to USD 2000. \nUpon further digging, researchers identified that the compromise methods in this campaign include brute-forcing passwords and malware, while scam tactics include phishing links and disinformation campaigns. All purchases are made through a middleman, ensuring authenticity.\nSellers can boost followers of purchased accounts for as low as USD 135, and buyers can add multiple affiliates for free but must pay USD 50 per affiliate to indicate the sub-account is part or affiliated with the Prime Gold account. \nThreat actors often replace unused accounts with their data, preventing the primary user from recovering. Researchers at CloudSEK collected six Twitter Gold-enabled accounts, with followers ranging from 2000 to over 72,000.\nThe first advertisement for Twitter Gold accounts was traced back to March 2023. The scam indicates that Twitter Gold services are not yet mature enough to handle such incidents, and cybercriminals can become guarantors of deals, creating a huge reseller market behind compromised accounts.\nTo minimize the risk of the Twitter Gold Buy scam, organizations should close dormant accounts if inactive for an extended period and train and educate employees on workplace cybersecurity practices. They must update password policies, educate them against cracked software, encourage using native password managers instead of web browsers, and install endpoint security software on employee devices to detect malicious software.\nInternational Sting Takes Down Major Dark Web Marketplace “Nemesis Market”\nIn a coordinated international effort, German authorities, working alongside law enforcement agencies from the United States and Lithuania, have successfully shut down the global darknet marketplace “Nemesis Market.” \nThe takedown, announced on March 22nd, 2024, by the Frankfurt am Main Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) of Germany, marks a significant blow to cybercrime operations on the dark web.\nNemesis Market, launched in 2021, had grown rapidly to become a major player in the dark web marketplace scene. Accessible only through the Tor network, the platform offered a haven for illicit activity, facilitating the sale of narcotics, stolen data, and a variety of cybercrime services.\nAccording to the German press release, investigations into the Nemesis Market began in October 2022, culminating in a concerted action on March 20th, 2024. The operation involved seizing server infrastructure located in Germany and Lithuania, effectively shutting down the marketplace. Additionally, German authorities confiscated cryptocurrency assets worth approximately €94,000, believed to be linked to the platform’s operations.\nThe investigation revealed a large user base for Nemesis Market, with over 150,000 user accounts and over 1,100 seller accounts identified worldwide. Notably, nearly 20% of these sellers were traced back to Germany, highlighting the platform’s reach. The marketplace offered a diverse range of illegal goods and services, including:\nThe press release emphasizes that the seized data from the marketplace will be used for further investigations to identify and prosecute the sellers and users involved. This takedown serves as a reminder of the ongoing international efforts to combat cybercrime on the dark web. Collaboration between law enforcement agencies from different countries is proving crucial in disrupting these illicit marketplaces and holding those responsible accountable.\nWhile the takedown of Nemesis Market is a victory for law enforcement, it’s important to acknowledge the persistence of the dark web. New marketplaces are likely to emerge, prompting the need for continued vigilance and international cooperation.\nChina Arrests 4 Who Weaponized ChatGPT for Ransomware Attacks\nChinese media has reported the country’s first major step towards countering the use of ChatGPT as four Chinese individuals have been arrested for developing ransomware using ChatGPT. This is the country’s first instance involving the popular yet officially banned chatbot.\nThe arrests should not come as a surprise, as cybercriminals have been eager to exploit the AI chatbot for malicious purposes. Those who could not exploit it have created their own versions of the malicious ChatGPT, infamously known as WormGPT and FraudGPT.\nAccording to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the cyber attackers came under the authorities’ radar after an unidentified company in Hangzhou reported a cybercrime. The hackers demanded 20,000 Tether to unblock\/restore access to their systems.\nIn late November 2023, the police arrested two suspects in Beijing and two in Inner Mongolia. The suspects admitted to writing ransomware versions, optimizing the program using the popular chatbot, conducting vulnerability scans, infiltrating networks to gain access and implanting ransomware, and performing extortion.\nThe use of ChatGPT, a chatbot developed by OpenAI, is prohibited in China as part of Beijing’s initiatives to limit access to foreign generative artificial intelligence products. In response, China has introduced its own version of ChatGPT named Ernie Bot. However, the report does not provide clear information on whether utilizing ChatGPT is subject to legal charges in China.\nAccording to SCMP’s report, three of the detainees were previously implicated in other criminal activities, including spreading misinformation and selling stolen CCTV footage through deep fake technology.\nDespite OpenAI blocking internet protocol addresses in China, Hong Kong, and sanctioned regions such as North Korea and Iran, certain users find ways to bypass these restrictions by using VPNs and obtaining phone numbers from supported areas. However, engaging in such circumvention practices may expose users to potential legal consequences.\nLegal cases involving the use of generative AI have increased in China due to its mass popularity and potential for crimes. In May 2023, reportedly, a man was detained in Gansu province for allegedly using ChatGPT to spread fake news about a train crash.\nVietnamese Group Hacks and Sells Bedroom Camera Footage\nA Vietnam-based Telegram group has been discovered selling private footage obtained from hacked security cameras, showcasing what they describe as ‘dark corners’ and ‘hot scenes.’ Security experts attribute this privacy breach to poor password hygiene as the primary cause.”\nIn 2021, cybersecurity researchers at BitDefender debated whether Telegram, an encrypted messaging app, had become the new dark web. As the world approaches 2024, the significance of this argument has never been more evident.\nAccording to details shared by security researcher Minh Hung, who first discovered the notorious Telegram group and published by Vnexpress, the group offers three packages for accessing the hacked footage. \nThe cheapest package costs 150,000 Vietnamese Dong ($6.16), while the highest package costs VND500,000 ($20.53). The top tier, ‘Super VIP,’ includes 4 years’ worth of hacked footage from hundreds of cameras and live access for VND800,000 ($32.84).\nThis group claims to specialize in hacking into “private cameras of families and shops in Vietnam” and invited Hung to join them on the channel.\nHackread.com also managed to identify Vietnamese-language Telegram channels offering malicious footage stolen from hacked home security cameras. The screenshots below were taken by Hackread.com:\nOn the other hand, according to Vnexpress’s report, Hung could watch the videos for the first and second packages, but with the third package, he could download an application from a camera firm and watch live feeds using the provided QR codes. Hung suspected it to be a scam but paid VND800,000 to check it out.\nHung further discovered that the timestamps on security camera feeds matched the current time. Using the application, he could access 15 cameras installed in clothing shops and spas, including bedrooms, living rooms, and dressing rooms.\nInstalling security cameras in your bedroom raises significant privacy concerns and is generally considered a bad idea. The bedroom is an intimate space where individuals expect the highest level of privacy. Placing cameras in this area not only invades personal boundaries but also raises ethical issues. \nThe footage captured in bedrooms can include highly sensitive and personal moments, compromising one’s privacy and dignity. Beyond the ethical aspect, it also poses a risk of unauthorized access by hackers, as demonstrated by this article.\nAdditionally, such surveillance within the confines of a home may lead to legal implications, as it potentially violates laws related to privacy. To maintain a sense of security and privacy, it is advisable to install cameras in public areas of the home while avoiding intrusion into personal spaces like bedrooms.\nwhether at home or work, protecting your security cameras from hackers is crucial to protect your privacy and security. Here are some vital tips to help you enhance the security of your security camera system:\nHackers Stole $59 Million of Crypto Via Malicious Google and X Ads\nWallet or cryptocurrency drainers have been a significant threat to users. These malicious programs illegally transfer cryptocurrency from victims’ wallets using various techniques, including campaign launches, deceptive websites, wallet connections, smart contract interaction, asset transfer, and obscuration.\nFor your information, a crypto drainer or cryptocurrency stealer is a type of malicious program designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. They work by tricking you into approving transactions that allow the attacker to transfer your funds away, often without your knowledge or consent.\nAnti-scam solutions provider Scam Sniffer has discovered a series of crypto drainer malware attacks stealing approximately $59 million from 63,210 victims by embedding a wallet drainer dubbed MS Drainer in Google search and X (formally Twitter) ads. The attack campaign leverages malicious ads on Google and X to redirect users to phishing pages.\nUnsuspecting users click on the ads linked to common keywords from the DeFi world. These ads can bypass ad audits and use redirect deception, targeting specific regions. Thousands of phishing sites were found using drainers between March 2023 and today, with spikes in activity in May, June, and November.\nThese sites were promoted in Google Search by exploiting Google’s tracking template. Ads on X were more prevalent, promoting NFT airdrops and new token launches on sites with drainers that steal funds from users’ wallets. \nResearchers monitored 10,072 phishing websites and found that 60% of ads on X directed users to malware designed to steal cryptocurrency. MS Drainer is available on a Dark Web forum, and unlike other malware where developers charge a 20% fee, its source code is sold directly to customers.\nOn December 22, Check Point Research (CPR) published research highlighting an alarming increase in sophisticated phishing attacks targeting various blockchain networks using crypto wallet-draining techniques, targeting Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and almost 20 other networks.\nCPR linked the attacks to Angel Drainer, a group known for its involvement in cyberattacks in the cryptocurrency space. Despite the shutdown of similar groups like Inferno Drainer, which helped steal over $80 million in cryptocurrency, Angel Drainer continues to operate. Attackers create fake airdrops or phishing campaigns, offering free tokens to lure users. They redirect users to a fraudulent website, requiring wallet connections.\nUsers are lured into interacting with smart contracts designed to steal tokens. Unknowingly, users grant attackers access to their funds, enabling token theft. Attackers use methods like mixers or multiple transfers to liquidate stolen assets. Permit in ERC-20 tokens allows token holders to approve spenders to transfer tokens without conducting on-chain transactions. However, if a user is tricked, the attacker can transfer funds without logging a trace to the blockchain.\nCPR and Scam Sniffer recommend that the advertising industry prevent malicious ads from reaching innocent users and urge consumers and users to exercise caution when opening links in online ads.\n“Ad platforms need to enhance their verification processes to prevent malicious actors from exploiting their services,” Scam Sniffer noted.\nInterpol Nets $300 Million, Arrests 3,500 in Major Cyber Crime Bust\nInterpol’s HAECHI IV operation, supported by the South Korean government, has led to the arrest of 3500 suspects and the seizure of assets worth $300m connected with organized cybercrime schemes. It was a six-month operation that started in July 2023.\nThe operation targeted seven types of scams: voice phishing, romance scams, sextortion, investment fraud, money laundering, business email compromise, and e-commerce fraud. Among these, investment fraud, business email compromise (BEC), and e-commerce fraud accounted for 75% of cases investigated involving police from 34 countries.\nAuthorities blocked 82,112 suspicious bank accounts and confiscated $199 million in cash and $101 million worth of crypto assets. Moreover, they collaborated with VASPs (virtual asset service providers) to identify\/freeze 367 virtual asset accounts, including cryptocurrency accounts, directly linked to transnational organized crime.\nThe highlight of the operation was the arrest of a high-profile online gambling criminal suspect after two years of searching. The suspect was arrested in Manila by Korea’s National Police Agency.\nHAECHI IV issued two purple notices to warn about new investment scam tactics, including selling fake NFTs and Deepfake technology. UK police reported cases of AI-generated content in impersonation scams, sextortion, and investment fraud.\nInterpol executive director of police services, Stephen Kavanagh, stated that seizing a “staggering sum” of $300m indicates why there has been an “explosive growth” in transnational organized crime.\n“This represents the savings and hard-earned cash of victims. This vast accumulation of unlawful wealth is a serious threat to global security and weakens the economic stability of nations worldwide,” Kavanagh added.\nINTERPOL’s National Central Bureau in Korea, Kim Dong Kwon, praised global efforts to stay ahead of criminal trends, stating that Project HAECHI will continue to evolve and expand its scope to ensure criminals are apprehended and face due punishment. The list of participating countries can be accessed here.\nThis isn’t the first such operation the Interpol has conducted in cooperation with transnational law enforcement agencies to nab cybercriminals and bust online crime networks. Earlier in December 2023, Hackread reported about Operation Storm Makers II, a global initiative by Interpol that led to the arrest of 281 individuals involved in human trafficking and migrant smuggling and the rescue of 149 victims through over 360 investigations.\nIn August, INTERPOL successfully dismantled the ’16shop’ phishing-as-a-service platform, arresting its operator and two facilitators with a joint effort between law enforcement and private sector partners, following Operation Narsil’s successful shutdown of a decade-old child abuse network.\nFBI Seizes Dark Web Domain of Blackcat – ALPHV Ransomware\nThe official website of the notorious ALPHV (aka Blackcat) has been seized by law enforcement authorities, including the FBI, the US DoJ, and several European security agencies under Europol.\nThe latest development should not come as a surprise, as a few days ago, the ALPHV gang went offline amid rumours that it had been taken down by law enforcement. These claims were categorically denied by the gang; however, today’s seizure confirms the previous rumours.\nAs seen by Hackread.com, the homepage of the ALPHV ransomware website was defaced with a banner announcing the seizure. However, the blog on which the ransomware gang advertised their hacks is still online and no seizure notice is seen at the time of writing. \n“This website has been seized – The Federal Bureau of Investigation seized this site as part of a coordinated law enforcement action taken against ALPHV Blackcat Ransomware. \nThis action has been taken in coordination with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice with substantial assistance from Europol and Zentrale Kriminalinspektion Göttingen. \nIf you have information about Blackcat, their affiliates, or activities, you may be eligible for a reward through the Department of State’s Rewards for Justice program.”\nIt’s safe to say that ALPHV ransomware has targeted a wide range of organizations across various industries, including critical infrastructure, finance, education, and manufacturing. However, the exact number of victims and the full extent of the damage remains unknown. The ALPHV gang’s known victims include MGM Resorts, NCR Data Center, Amazon’s Ring, and several others, among which are the following:\nAlthough the FBI has not officially announced the seizure, it appears that no arrests were made, and only the domain was taken offline. On the other hand, the Department of Justice (DoJ) has also released a press statement confirming that there is a decryption tool available for the ransomware and victims around the world are welcome to contact the FBI for access to the tool.\n“In disrupting the BlackCat ransomware group, the Justice Department has once again hacked the hackers,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “With a decryption tool provided by the FBI to hundreds of ransomware victims worldwide, businesses and schools were able to reopen, and health care and emergency services were able to come back online. We will continue to prioritize disruptions and place victims at the center of our strategy to dismantle the ecosystem fueling cybercrime.”\nHowever, in a tweet, the online malware repository Vx-Underground claimed that they were contacted by the gang’s team, revealing that they had already moved their server to a new domain.\nALPHV ransomware group administrative group has contacted us to inform us they have moved their servers and blogs.*Image translated from Russian to English pic.twitter.com\/W01YC2jHAa\nAs of now, attributing ALPHV to a specific group or country with certainty is difficult due to the nature of cybercrime and the group’s efforts to remain anonymous. Nevertheless, this article will be updated with additional information.

This action followed an investigation aimed at disrupting the fake Microsoft account network known as Storm-1152, extensively utilized by cybercriminals.\nResearchers believe that cracking down on fraudulent accounts is crucial because cybercrime relies on fraudulent accounts as these act as digital keys for mass phishing, spam campaigns, and ransomware attacks.\nThe use of fraudulent and stolen login credentials by cybercriminals for large-scale data breaches is an undeniable reality. The recent attack on OAuth app users, as revealed by Microsoft just yesterday, serves as a small example amidst more significant incidents.\nFor your information, Storm-1152 is the world’s leading seller and creator of fraudulent Microsoft accounts. The platform has been exposed through a collaborative effort between Microsoft Threat Intelligence and cybersecurity firm Arkose’s Cyber Threat Intelligence Research unit (ACTIR). \nAccording to Microsoft’s report, Storm-1152 operates a network of illicit websites and social media pages, selling fake Microsoft accounts and identity verification bypass tools. So far, the operators have generated around 750 million fraudulent accounts, leaving a trail of destruction. \nStorm-1152, a notorious group in the cybercrime-as-a-service (CaaS) industry, specializes in producing and selling millions of fraudulent Microsoft accounts. The group is impactful because it lowers the barrier to entry, enabling a wider range of actors to engage in cybercrime. This efficiency boosts the scope and frequency of cyberattacks, impacting countless individuals and businesses.\nMicrosoft aims to dismantle Storm-1152’s infrastructure and disrupt the entire ecosystem that enables their activities, aiming to create a safer online environment for everyone. Microsoft has obtained a court order from the Southern District of New York to seize U.S.-based infrastructure and offline websites used by Storm-1152 to harm Microsoft customers.\nThe case focuses on fraudulent Microsoft accounts and services sold to bypass security measures on other technology platforms. Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit disrupted Hotmailbox.me, 1stCAPTCHA, AnyCAPTCHA, and NoneCAPTCHA, which facilitate CAPTCHA solve service sales and identity verification bypass tools for other platforms. \nResearchers have also uncovered links between Storm-1152’s network and various cybercrime groups, including Octo Tempest, Storm-0252, and Storm-0455.\nNevertheless, this was a multi-phased operation launched to expose the people operating the malicious servers. Researchers used various investigative techniques, including network traffic analysis, telemetry data, and reverse engineering, to identify the source of the storm.\nThey identified three individuals, Duong Dinh Tu, Linh Van Nguyễn, and Tai Van Nguyen, as the masterminds behind the Storm-1152 machine. They hosted illegitimate platforms, authored the code, published tutorials, and offered live chat support.\nExposing the individuals behind Storm-1152 was crucial in dismantling this criminal network and holding accountable those who actively enabled online crime. Additionally, this coordinated takedown sends a clear message to Storm-1152 and others following their path: they are being watched and soon will be caught.\nMicrosoft: Storm-1283 Sent 927,000 Phishing Emails with Malicious OAuth Apps\nMicrosoft has discovered a sophisticated cybercrime scheme by Storm-1283 threat actor who infiltrated a user account to hijack digital keys and mine cryptocurrency within the Microsoft cloud platform Azure. \nAccording to the Microsoft Threat Intelligence unit’s research, the attacker utilized compromised user accounts to establish inbox rules with suspicious names, redirecting emails to the junk folder and marking them as read. Additionally, the malicious OAuth applications created by the actor were responsible for sending over 927,000 phishing emails.\nIn this campaign, hackers exploited the OAuth feature, which permits apps to access user data with proper authorization. They pilfer digital keys, enabling them to cause havoc through phishing or brute force—cracking weak passwords or deceiving users into divulging their login credentials. Once inside, they create or modify OAuth applications with elevated access, effectively transforming them into ‘master keys’ for online resources.\nThese stolen keys are used for cryptocurrency mining, granting hackers lasting access even if passwords are changed. Email and spam sprees are also common, as the master key grants hackers lasting access. \nStorm-1283 breached a user account, gaining access to a virtual private network and tenant domain within Microsoft Entra ID. They created a new “OAuth application” using stolen credentials, allowing them to control resources within the compromised account. \nThey double-dipped existing OAuth applications, adding secret credentials to these keys. With the keys, Storm-1283 deployed virtual machines (VMs) within the compromised Azure subscription, generating cryptocurrency for their illicit gains. They re-entered the cloud, deploying more VMs to maximize their operation. \nThe targeted organizations suffered financial losses ranging from $10,000 to $1.5 million. Microsoft’s security researchers discovered the suspicious activity and exposed the hacker’s tactics, including masking VMs by mimicking the domain name. \nMicrosoft analysts also detected a threat actor who compromised user accounts and created OAuth applications to maintain persistence and launch email phishing activity. The actor used an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing kit to send a significant number of emails with varying subject lines and URLs to target user accounts in multiple organizations. \nMicrosoft worked with the Microsoft Entra team to block the OAuth applications involved in the attack and advised further actions. \nThe company also observed large-scale spamming activity through OAuth applications by Storm-1286. The actor launched password-spraying attacks to compromise user accounts, most of which did not have multifactor authentication (MFA). \nThe user agent BAV2ROPC was observed in sign-in activities related to the compromised accounts, indicating the use of legacy authentication protocols such as IMAP and SMTP that do not support MFA. \nMicrosoft Threat Intelligence has limited the actor’s activity by taking down all malicious OAuth applications related to this campaign, which ran from July to November 2023.\nDoControl‘s Vice President of Solution Consulting, Tim Davis, also commented on this campaign with Hackread.com, urging for making the cloud platform secure.\n“These types of attacks underscore the need for visibility into what both systems and users are doing on any cloud platform. Both limiting of permissions (the least privilege or zero trust model) and robust anomaly detection are critical to protecting resources that are located in the cloud.”\nScammers Weaponize Google Forms in New BazarCall Attack\nCybersecurity researchers at Abnormal Security have identified a new attack campaign in which scammers use the BazarCall technique (BazaCall or Callback phishing) to target victims. This time, however, the notorious phishing attack method has taken a sophisticated turn by incorporating Google Forms to enhance its deceptive strategies. \nHere, it is worth noting that Abnormal Security’s findings came just a couple of weeks after the FBI warned users of the Silent Ransom Group (SRG), also identified as Luna Moth, employing Callback phishing techniques for network hacks.\nIn the usual scenario, the BazarCall attack typically begins with a phishing email masquerading as a payment notification or subscription confirmation from familiar brands. The email prompts recipients to call a provided phone number to dispute charges or cancel a service, creating a sense of urgency. However, the real objective is to trick victims into installing malware during the phone call, exposing organizations to future cyber threats.\nWhat sets this BazarCall variant apart is its utilization of Google Forms to elevate the authenticity of malicious emails. The attacker crafts a Google Form, adding details about a fake transaction, including an invoice number and payment information. The response receipt option is then activated, sending a copy of the completed form to the target’s email address.\nIn a blog post, Mike Britton Chief Information Security Officer at Abnormal Security, said that the attacker manipulates the process further by sending the form invitation to themselves, completing it with the target’s email address, and making it look like a payment confirmation for a product or service. Using Google Forms, sent from a legitimate Google address, enhances the attack’s legitimacy, making it harder to detect.\nThe uniqueness of this BazarCall lies in its difficulty to be identified by traditional email security tools. Unlike typical threats with malicious links or attachments, this attack relies on Google Forms, a trusted service for surveys and quizzes. \nThe dynamic nature of Google Forms URLs further complicates detection, as they frequently change, evading static analysis and signature-based detection used by many security tools. Mike further noted that legacy email security tools, such as secure email gateways (SEGs), struggle to discern the malicious intent behind these emails, leading to potential threats slipping through the cracks. \nHowever, modern AI-native email security solutions with behavioural AI and content analysis can accurately identify and thwart such attacks by recognizing brand impersonation and phishing attempts. \nIn a statement to Hackread.com, Google confirmed its awareness of a newly emerging, yet isolated, phishing campaign utilizing Forms.\n“Workspace has numerous layers of defences to keep users safe. We are aware of the recent phishing attacks using Forms, and while they appear to be isolated to a small number of users, we are working to improve detection.”\nNevertheless, in navigating the evolving cyber threats, staying informed about sophisticated attack methods like this BazarCall variant is crucial. Adopting advanced email security solutions that leverage artificial intelligence is paramount to effectively protect organizations and individuals from the ever-changing tactics of cybercriminals.\nFake Resumes, Real Malware: TA4557 Exploits Recruiters for Backdoor Access\nTA4557, a skilled yet mysterious cybercriminal group, has been targeting recruiters with malware since October 2023, as revealed in the latest report from Proofpoint published on 12 December 2023.\nAccording to Proofpoint’s research, TA4577 sends direct emails to recruiters to deliver malware. These emails appear benign, expressing interest in an open job. When the recipient replies, that’s when the attack chain begins.\nTA4557 is a financially motivated threat actor known to distribute the More_Eggs backdoor against recruiters on LinkedIn. For most of 2022 and 2023, the threat actor applied to existing open job listings and embedded malicious URLs in the application. \nHowever, they have changed tactics in the latest campaign where they utilize both the new method of sending direct emails and the older technique of applying to jobs posted on public job boards, but the intention remains the same.\nIn early November 2023, security vendor Proofpoint observed campaigns where TA4557 directed recipients to refer to the domain name of their email address to access their portfolio instead of sending the resume website URL directly. The actor then directed victims to a personal website mimicking a candidate’s resume or job site that used filtering to redirect users to the next stage of the attack chain. \nOnce the victim passes filtering checks, they are taken to a resume in plain text or a candidate website, which uses a CAPTCHA to initiate the downloading of a shortcut file (.LNK) that abuses legitimate software functions to download\/execute a scriptlet called Living Off The Land (LOTL).\nThis script decrypts and drops a DLL to create a new regsrv32 process using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) and uses multiple checks to determine whether the DLL is being debugged. This DLL also drops the More_Eggs backdoor and initiates the creation of the MSXSL process using the WMI service.\nAs per Proofpoint’s report, TA4557 is unique due to its unique tool\/malware usage, campaign targeting, job candidate-themed lures, sophisticated evasive measures, distinct attack chains, and actor-controlled infrastructure. this group’s activity has historically overlapped with cybercrime group FIN6 activities and the malware suite used by cybercrime groups Cobalt Group and Evilnum.\nTA4557  demonstrates sophisticated social engineering, designs its lures to legitimate job opportunities posted online, uses benign messages to build trust and engages with targets before sending malicious content. \nThe group regularly changes its sender emails, fake resume domains, and infrastructure, which makes it difficult for defenders and automated security tools to detect the content as malicious.\nTherefore, organizations using third-party job posting websites should be aware of TA4557’s tactics and educate employees regarding this threat, especially in recruiting and hiring functions.\nSpanish Police Nab Venezuelan Leader of Kelvin Security Hacker Group\nIn an announcement on December 10, 2023, the Spanish National Police in Alicante city revealed the arrest of the alleged leader of the financial arm of ‘Kelvin Security,’ a notorious hacking group.\nIdentified as a Venezuelan citizen, apparently, under the suspect’s leadership, the Kelvin Security group was involved in over 300 high-profile cyber attacks spanning the last three years, targeting strategic sectors in more than 90 countries.\nThe group’s modus operandi involved exploiting vulnerabilities in strategic entities to gain access credentials and extract confidential information. Subsequently, they traded this sensitive data on various cybercrime, hacking and dark web forums.\nThe arrested Venezuelan individual now faces charges including membership in a criminal organization, disclosure of secrets, computer damage, and money laundering. He is believed to be the central figure responsible for laundering funds obtained through the group’s illicit activities, primarily utilizing cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThe investigation initiated two years ago, originated from sophisticated cyber attacks on the computer systems of Spanish municipalities Getafe and Camas. Cyber investigation experts traced these attacks back to the cybercrime forums operated by the ‘Kelvin Security group on the dark web.\nExploiting vulnerabilities in websites, software, and information storage services, the group systematically extracted sensitive data from institutions and entities in strategic sectors globally. Their latest known attack occurred in November 2023, when they exfiltrated a database containing confidential information of over 85,000 customers from an energy company.\nThe apprehension of the suspected leader of the Kelvin Security hacker group underscores the determination of cybercriminals to conceal their tracks, yet authorities consistently stay one step ahead.\nUkraine Arrests Hackers for Selling 100 Million Email, Instagram Accounts\nThe Ukrainian Cyber Police, working alongside investigators from the national police, have pulled off a major win in the fight against cybercrime. They successfully arrested three individuals accused of hacking and selling a staggering 100 million email and Instagram accounts on the dark web.\nAuthorities believe the group used a brute-force attack technique, essentially bombarding accounts with numerous password combinations until they cracked the login credentials. These stolen accounts were then compiled into a database and offered for sale on dark web marketplaces and hacking forums, where malicious hackers could purchase them for fraudulent activities.\nIt is worth mentioning that currently, some of the most active and popular hacker and cybercrime forums include Breach Forums and a Russian language platform called XSS. Cybercriminals utilize these forums to sell stolen data through escrow deals, while others opt to leak it for free. Additionally, Telegram serves as a significant platform for criminals to announce data breaches and either leak or sell data.\nAccording to Cyber Police’s press release, the buyers used the stolen accounts to launch various scams, including the notorious “Friend Asks for a Loan” scheme where compromised accounts are used to target the victim’s friends and family with fabricated requests for money.\nAdditionally, law enforcement officers conducted 7 searches at the residences and registered addresses of individuals involved in Kyiv, Odesa, Vinnytsia, and Ivano-Frankivsk, as well as in the regions of Kyiv, Donetsk, and Kirovohrad. During these searches, over 70 pieces of computer equipment, 14 phones, bank cards, and cash, totalling more than $3,000, were seized. A petition has been submitted to the court to request the seizure of the confiscated property.\nThe ages of the arrested suspects range from 20 to 40. They now face charges of unauthorized interference in information systems and networks, a serious offence in Ukraine punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\nThe investigation isn’t over yet, however. Authorities suspect the group may have collaborated with foreign entities, particularly those with interests aligned with Russia. Investigators are looking into the possibility that some of the stolen accounts were used specifically to benefit Russian interests, though the exact nature of this potential collaboration remains unclear.\nCommenting on this, Jamie Akhtar, CEO and Co-Founder at CyberSmart said: “Following the takedown of LockBit in February, this is another heartening story. It demonstrates that cybercriminals can be caught and brought to justice. However, we shouldn’t rest on our laurels, for each of these groups that is shut down another will spring up in its place and those still at large will learn from how their peers were caught.”\nThis arrest goes on to show the importance of taking cybersecurity measures. Using strong and unique passwords for all online accounts is crucial, and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) whenever possible adds an extra layer of security. The Ukrainian cyber police also recommend these practices to help protect yourself from falling victim to similar account hijacking schemes.\nWhile the full extent of the data breach remains under investigation, it’s a significant development and a win for law enforcement. The stolen accounts could have been used for a wide range of malicious activities, and their seizure disrupts a major operation within the cybercriminal underworld.\nInterpol Busts Human Traffickers Luring Victims with Fake Online Job Ads\nThe Interpol operation targeting human trafficking-fueled fraud, named Operation Storm Makers II, has uncovered that crimes are spreading beyond Southeast Asia. This global initiative is designed to combat human trafficking and migrant smuggling, shedding light on the intricate network of cyber scams. Law enforcement agencies from 27 countries were mobilized for this operation.\nInterpol’s efforts have generated significant results, leading to the arrest of 281 individuals involved in a range of offences, including human trafficking, passport forgery, corruption, telecommunications fraud, and sexual exploitation. Additionally, authorities have successfully rescued 149 victims through over 360 investigations, with some still ongoing.\nThe operation covered a range of cyber scam cases, including 40 Malaysian victims lured to Peru for a high-paying job, and several citizens taken to Dubai for employment before being diverted to Thailand and Myanmar. It involved over 270,000 inspections and police checks at 450 human trafficking global hotspots between 16 and 20 October.\nInvestigators found that increasing cyber fraud schemes involving fake crypto investments, work-from-home, lottery and online gambling scams are encouraging human trafficking globally. Victims are often trafficked to cyber scam centers, where they are lured through fake job ads and forced to commit online fraud.\nIt is worth noting that earlier this year, Interpol shut down a notorious phishing-as-a-service platform called 16shop involved in the sale of ‘phishing kits’ to hackers to scam internet users. \nIn a press release, Interpol’s assistant director of vulnerable communities, Rosemary Nalubega, stated that the human cost of cyber scams is continually rising and the only productive option to tackle it is concerted global action. Operation Storm Makers II has proven effective in diverting law enforcement’s attention towards cyber scams. \nIn India, police registered one of their first cases of human trafficking through cyber fraud whereas in Myanmar since 2022, authorities have reported rescuing trafficking victims from 22 countries, mainly from Kayin and Shan States.\nApart from the cyber scam centres, Operation Storm Makers II revealed other human trafficking and migrant smuggling offences. A 13-year-old boy from Bangladesh, who was trafficked to India, has been rescued. Two female victims from Nepal were rescued from India and sent home. \nTurkish law enforcement caught 239 migrant smugglers while patrolling the country’s coastline, and intercepted around 4,000 irregular migrants. The operation also focuses on prevention, and member countries have rolled out awareness campaigns to help potential victims avoid being trafficked.\nParticipating countries include Angola, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam.\nWilliam Wright, CEO of Closed Door Security endorsed Interpol’s work. In a statement to Hackread.com, Wright said “The latest announcement from Interpol highlights how the whole criminal ecosystem is becoming increasingly interlinked. Now we are seeing people being trafficked and forced to commit cyber fraud, which links two of the biggest underworld industries. Gangs are now resorting to kidnapping to force people to carry out fraud, which also shows just how far beyond digital cybercrime has become today.”\nWright warned that despite the large-scale operation and its success, there is much more to be done. “The update highlights just how many scam centres are in operation today, but the numbers announced by Interpol are a drop in the ocean in comparison to the reality,”  he added.\n“To fight back against these horrible crimes, we need to see more collaboration from law enforcement across the world, where data is shared, and criminals are publicly sanctioned. We must also make consumers more aware of these scams, so they are better educated to recognise them and ignore them, before clicking on a malicious link or handing over their confidential information. Doing this will have a knock-on effect on scam centre profits, which will significantly hurt the criminals behind them,”  Wright warned.\nFake hotel reservation phishing scam uses PDF links to spread MrAnon Stealer\nCybersecurity researchers at FortiGuard Labs have brought to light a new email phishing campaign exploiting false hotel reservations to lure unsuspecting victims. The phishing attack involves the deployment of a malicious PDF file that, once opened, unleashes a chain of events leading to the activation of the MrAnon Stealer malware.\nRather than relying on complex technical details, the attackers cunningly pose as a hotel reservation company, sending phishing emails under the subject, “December Room Availability Query.” The email body contains fabricated holiday season booking details, with the malicious PDF file hiding a downloader link.\nUpon closer inspection, cybersecurity experts at FortiGuard Labs uncovered a multi-stage process involving .NET executable files, PowerShell scripts, and deceptive Windows Form presentations. The attackers, posing as a hotel reservation company, skillfully navigate through these stages, using tactics like false error messages to cloak the successful execution of the malware.\nThe MrAnon Stealer, a Python-based infostealer, operates discreetly, compressing its activities with cx-Freeze to slip past detection mechanisms. The malware executes a meticulous process that includes capturing screenshots, retrieving IP addresses, and stealing sensitive data from various applications.\nThe attackers demonstrate sophistication by terminating specific processes on the victim’s system and masquerading as legitimate connections to fetch IP addresses, country names, and country codes. The stolen data, including credentials, system information, and browser sessions, is compressed, secured with a password, and uploaded to a public file-sharing website.\nAccording to FortiGuard Labs’ blog post, MrAnon Stealer can gather information from cryptocurrency wallets, browsers, and messaging apps such as Discord, Discord Canary, Element, Signal, and Telegram Desktop. Additionally, it targets VPN clients like NordVPN, ProtonVPN, and OpenVPN Connect.\nAs for its command and control; the attackers use the Telegram channel as a communication medium. The stolen data, system information, and a download link are sent to the attacker’s Telegram channel using a bot token.\nThis campaign, active and aggressive during November 2023, primarily targeted Germany, as indicated by the surge in queries for the downloader URL during that period. The cybercriminals behind this operation have exhibited a strategic approach, shifting from Cstealer in July and August to the more potent MrAnon Stealer in October and November.\nIf you are online, you are vulnerable. Therefore, users are advised to exercise caution when dealing with unexpected emails, especially those containing dubious attachments. Cautiousness and commonsense are keys to thwarting cybercriminals’ attempts to exploit human vulnerabilities and compromise online security.\nUSPS Delivery Phishing Scam Exploits SaaS Providers to Steal Data\nCybersecurity researchers at Bloster AI have uncovered a new USPS Delivery Phishing campaign that employs sophisticated techniques to target victims in the United States.\nIt comes as no surprise that cybercriminals are employing sophisticated techniques to exploit reputable services for scams, making it challenging for innocent consumers to enjoy the holiday shopping season. This pattern is evident in the ongoing scam attack against Booking.com customers. \nAccording to Bloster AI, an automated digital risk protection service, Walmart is a prime target this season due to the higher volume of shipping needs during November and December in the USPS phishing attack. Bolster’s CheckPhish has already discovered over 3,000 phishing domains mimicking Walmart.\nThe extensive phishing campaign mimics USPS, tricking consumers into thinking they have failed deliveries and late payments. Threat actors have substantially improved their attack tactics, transitioning from deceptive\/misleading messages to luring victims into downloading financial\/banking data-stealing apps.\nIn their blog post, researchers noted that the domain walmartsco was active while they were writing the blog post. This domain mainly mimicked Walmart’s domain name and served USPS delivery tracking-related content and redirects to the authentic USPS portal to evade detection mechanisms. \nScammers distribute phishing links via email or SMS and use stolen data to lure victims into giving away sensitive banking data via social engineering techniques. Once a victim’s bank details are acquired, attackers can purchase, transfer money, or gain monetary benefits. \nPhishing sites contain a site title such as USPS.com® – USPS Tracking® Results, and are designed to steal sensitive information like email addresses, names, phone numbers, residential addresses, and credit\/debit card information. These sites cleverly redirect hyperlinks to legitimate USPS websites and use IP location to evade detection.\nIn some instances, hackers utilized personal information stolen in this scam, such as email address, phone number, or name, and sent emails\/phishing scams pretending to be the victim. Such attacks involving social engineering are more successful if the email\/SMS comes from a believable source.\nSome phishing sites may also display tracking details as per the victim’s IP locations to appear authentic. Moreover, Bolster researchers noted that threat actors rely on these sites on pushed domains and exploit free hosting services. \nThese include DNS service hosting provider alviy.com and clear-cloud.com, an app hosting\/deploying\/maintaining tools provider. Attackers also host phishing sites using available domain names on now-dns.com and forumz.info, etc.\nThis campaign highlights the dangers of exploiting free hosting services and vulnerabilities in e-commerce platforms. Threat actors are focusing more on SaaS services and using AI technology, social media phishing, and brand impersonation scams to steal\/lure customers from profitable sectors, such as finance, healthcare, and government agencies. \nThis phishing campaign primarily targets USPS customers in the US, but you may never know when attackers decide to expand the scope of this scam. It has impacted legitimate businesses’ reputations during the busy holiday shopping season. Proactive measures to identify and remove pre-malicious domains either manually or through automated takedown services are crucial to retaining consumer trust. \nUS Man Jailed 8 Years for SIM Swapping and Apple Support Impersonation\nA 25-year-old man from downtown Los Angeles has been sentenced to 8 years in federal prison for orchestrating a series of online scams that defrauded hundreds of victims of over $740,000.\nAmir Hossein Golshan (PDF) was convicted of one count of unauthorized access to a protected computer to obtain information, one count of wire fraud, and one count of accessing a computer to defraud and obtain value.\nGolshan’s schemes involved SIM swapping, social media account takeovers, Zelle payment fraud, and impersonating Apple Support personnel. He used these methods to steal money, NFTs, cryptocurrency, and other valuable digital property from his victims.\n\nIt looks like the SIM swapper who impersonated Apple Support to steal $386K worth of crypto and NFTs (BAYC 9012) from @Mr312 last year was just sentenced to 8 years in prison + ordered to pay $1.2M in restitution.How do we know it’s his scammer? In the DOJ press release they… pic.twitter.com\/qBrWBpROVg\nIn one instance, Golshan targeted a Los Angeles-based model and influencer with over 100,000 Instagram followers. He gained access to her Instagram account and impersonated her to her friends, requesting them to send him money through Zelle, PayPal, and other online payment platforms.\nSeveral of the victim’s friends sent Golshan money, totalling thousands of dollars, believing they were sending money to the victim. In another instance, Golshan impersonated Apple Support personnel to gain unauthorized access to several victims’ Apple iCloud accounts. He then stole NFTs, cryptocurrency, and other valuable digital property from these accounts.\nIn another case, he stole an NFT valued at approximately $319,000 and approximately $70,000 worth of cryptocurrency from a victim. U.S. District Judge Otis D. Wright II, who sentenced Golshan, stated that his crimes went “beyond just money” and that they showed a “wanton cruelty” that caused the victims to live in a state of “constant fear and worry.”\nAccording to the US Department of Justice’s press release on Monday, November 27, 2023, Golshan has been in federal custody since June 2023 for violating the terms of his pretrial release. In addition to his prison sentence, he is ordered to pay $1,218,526 in restitution to his victims.\nUS Seizes Bitcoin Mixer Sinbad.io Used by Lazarus Group\nThe official domain of Sinbad.io, a popular Bitcoin “mixer” service has been seized by the United States government. The reason to seize the service given by the US Treasury is that the service apparently, was involved in laundering millions of dollars stolen by North Korean state-based notorious Lazarus group.\nThose visiting Sinbad.io can now encounter a homepage uploaded by the government of the United States, announcing the following:\nThis service has been seized as part of a coordinated law-enforcement action between the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Intelligence and Investigation Service (FIOD), and the National Bureau of Investigation taken against the Sinbad.io cryptocurrency mixing service. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has seized the service in accordance with a seizure warrant pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 55 981 and 982 as part of a coordinated international law-enforcement operation.\nIn a press release dated November 29, 2023, the Treasury accused Sinbad.io of processing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency obtained from various sources. These sources reportedly include large-scale data breaches, notably the $100 million hack affecting Horizon Bridge in June 2022, the $620 million from the Axie Infinity hack in March 2022, and the impact on customers of Atomic Wallet in June 2023.\nThe US government further claimed that Sinbad.io is not only used for financial crimes but is also a tool employed by cybercriminals for “obfuscating transactions” associated with activities such as sanctions evasion, drug trafficking, purchasing child sexual abuse materials, and other illicit sales on dark web marketplaces.\nThe Lazarus group, operating under the control of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), is infamous for its hacking activities. The US alleges that Sinbad.io serves as a “key money-laundering tool” for the already-sanctioned Lazarus group, which is believed to have stolen a staggering $2 billion worth of digital assets over its operational history.\nAccording to the Q3 2023 Crypto Losses Report by Immunefi, a blockchain cybersecurity firm, the cryptocurrency industry incurred a loss of $685.5 million, marking the highest quarterly loss for the year. \nThe two largest exploits of the quarter were on Mixin Network and Multichain, which together accounted for 47.5% of all losses. The Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group, was responsible for $208.6 million in stolen funds, representing 30% of the total losses.\nAs for Sinbad.io, it operates on the Bitcoin blockchain and is considered by experts to be a successor to the previously sanctioned crypto mixer, Blender.io. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Blender.io on May 6, 2022.\nHowever, ddespite authorities shutting down the original Sinbad.io address, a mirrored site surfaced, registered in Moscow on November 18. A Google search for the original Sinbad.io now shows a copycat site, 1sinbadgo.com, as the second result. Notably, the copycat site, which also boasts a .Onion domain, claims to provide identical services to the original seized domain.\nNevertheless, the sanctions imposed by the US require the blocking and reporting of “all property and interests in property” belonging to Sinbad.io that are within the United States or under the possession or control of US persons, according to the press release.\nScammers Exploit Crypto Hype with Fake Token Factory, Stealing Millions\nCheck Point Research team has discovered a new type of scamming operation leveraging a fake token factory to steal millions of dollars from innocent users. Check Point’s Threat Intel blockchain system identified a malicious wallet address that has been involved in “blacklisted activities.” \nResearchers then started monitoring the activities linked with the wallet address and found that this address operated forty (40) different rug pulls, and so far, the scammers have stolen 1 million USD.\nThe scam involves creating fake tokens, adding money to the liquidity pool to create a sense of legitimacy about these tokens, and arranging fake trades to make it appear as if genuine buying and selling were occurring. \nThen, the scammers pump up the token’s volume to create an allusion that it is in high demand. This is done to attract buyers. Then, they take the money from the liquidity pool once the token has lured sufficient investors. Researchers explained the scam with an example in their technical blog published on 21 November 2023.\n“For example, the token name GROK 2.0, possibly derived from a well-known AI system (X GROK), is intended to attract buyers.”\nThe scammer used two smart contracts to trade and pump up the token volume. It is worth noting that the function (0x521da65d) is used for selling\/buying tokens for the first smart contract. It has been executed 226 times for just this token.\nFor the second smart contract, the scammers used another address (0x4b2a0290e41623fbfeb5f6a0ea52dc261b65e29b) and executed the function (0xf029e7cf) to boost the token’s volume artificially. From their liquidity pool, the scammer has removed funds 81 times.\nFor your information, Rug Pull scams are like exit scams, where developers make fraudulent promises and exit right after stealing investors’ funds.\nThis Rug Pull incident highlights the importance of staying vigilant and informed in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Investors should be aware of the tactics employed by scammers and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investments.\nCheck Point is committed to safeguarding the crypto community and actively monitoring domains associated with the identified scammer’s wallet address. Hackread.com will update readers when the company discloses more details on this scam.\nTelekopye Toolkit Used as Telegram Bot to Scam Marketplace Users\nIn their latest report, ESET researchers have disclosed their findings on the Telekopye toolkit that simplifies online scamming for individuals with limited technical expertise. This is a follow-up report. The company shared a preliminary analysis on Telekopye in August 2023.\nResearchers have delved deeper into the onboard process of the scammers to unearth the wicked scamming operation, including the explanation of different scam scenarios they are using to deceive users.\nTelekopye Toolkit is implemented as a Telegram bot and helps cyber criminals scam unsuspecting users in online marketplaces. This tool allows scammers to create phishing websites, fabricate fake screenshots, and transmit emails, SMS messages, etc.\nAs per ESET telemetry, Telekopye Toolkit is operational and under active development. The scammers call their victims Mammoths, and ESET has assigned scammers the name Neanderthals.\nResearch reveals that scammers (ESET researchers have named the scammers utilizing Telekopye Toolkit as Neanderthals) are recruited via advertisements distributed across different online channels, mainly underground forums. These ads are designed to defraud online marketplace users. \nInterested Neanderthals have to complete an application form and answer key questions about their previous experience in this kind of work. Existing group members approve them with relevant ranks and give them full access to Telekopye’s functionalities.\nIn a blog post, ESET researchers identified three different scam scenarios.\nIn this scam, attackers pose as sellers and entice users into purchasing items that don’t exist. Suppose the victim expresses interest in buying the item. In that case, the seller lures them into making an online payment and gives them a phishing website link, which appears as a legitimate payment portal. But this website solicits the victim’s banking credentials or credit card details (may even provide balance information) and transfers the data to the scammers. Sellers internally refer to this scam as 1.0.\nThis scam is referred to as 2.0. Attackers pose as buyers in this scam and target their victims after comprehensive research. They express interest in an item and claim to have paid through the provided platform. They send the victim a Telekopye Toolkit-created SMS or email containing a link to a phishing website. The victim is persuaded to click this link to receive the payment from the platform. The remaining method is similar to the seller scam.\nThis scenario entails Neanderthals creating a situation where the Mammoth expects a refund. The scammer sends them a phishing email with a link to a phishing website. This email can be sent to victims the scammers haven’t contacted before or used in combination with the seller scam. They exploit the greed of victims who want this non-existent refund. In seller scams, when the victims don’t receive the goods, they are again scammed by Neanderthals via refund phishing emails.\nEvery Neanderthal had to join a group where they communicated the rules and manuals and another channel where transaction logs were stored. Telekopye Toolkit attackers refer to law enforcement and researchers as rats and try to stick to their rules.\nThe scam primarily targets popular Russian online marketplaces like YULA or OLX, but ESET researchers also observed non-Russian targets, including eBay, Sbazar, Jófogás, and BlaBlaCar.\nIf you are a Telegram user, there are several ways to protect yourself from such bots including the following:\nEuropol Busts Major Online CSAM Racket in Western Balkans\nIn recent years, Europol has supported law enforcement agencies around the world to identify and arrest hundreds of suspects and to rescue thousands of child victims. To further intensify its efforts to combat online child sexual abuse, Operation MOZAIK 2023 was launched to identify and arrest people utilizing online forums and messaging apps to share child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online.\nEuropol’s press release states that law enforcement authorities in the Western Balkan region have identified 39 suspects from eight countries. The suspects were involved in a major child sexual abuse racket operating in the Western Balkan region.  \nEuropol supervised this operation, whereas the Slovenian National Police led it. It involved cooperation from agencies in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia (Slovenia, Croatia and Hungary). \nA series of law enforcement actions was conducted between 6 and 17 November 2023. During the operation, 41 raids were conducted, and investigators uncovered a vast network of individuals engaged in the sharing\/distribution of CSAM. \nAuthorities managed to seize around 200 items (computers, memory cards, computer servers, and mobile phones) containing images\/videos of CSAM were confiscated. Three suspects were already under arrest for crimes involving child sexual abuse.\nThe identification of 39 suspects marks a breakthrough and an indication of the operation’s success because, in addition to identifying the suspects, the operation also led to the rescue of two child victims. They will receive support to recover from the abuse, whereas the suspects will be tried in court for their crimes.\nThe Slovenian National Police press release clarified that there are no Slovenian children among the victims. Additionally, the investigation has not confirmed that the suspects themselves created the material under investigation or were involved in physically and sexually abusing children. \n“However, with the information collected so far, it was established that some suspects paid for child sexual abuse material with cryptocurrencies, and also operated on the dark web (in the darknet network),” explained the statement.\nThe operation is the latest in a series of Europol-coordinated actions to combat online child sexual abuse. Earlier in November, Hackread reported that a 36-year-old Lawton, Oklahoma resident, Austen Peppers, was sentenced to over 21 years in prison for advertising and distributing CSAM on the dark web. \nNow, the agency has launched a crackdown against CSAM distributors in the Western Balkan region, which is a prioritized region for Europol under its EMPACT framework (European Multidisciplinary Platform Against Criminal Threats) that facilitates cross-border cooperation between law enforcement agencies in Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary, and Europol. \nOnline child sexual abuse is a global problem that requires a global response. The perpetrators of such heinous crimes have been using advanced methods to make money, such as using artificial intelligence (AI) to produce CSAM. \nA recent report by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) revealed a significant rise in cybercriminals utilizing generative AI platforms to produce child sexual abuse material (CSAM). This growing preference for deep fake content, particularly involving minors, raises serious concerns due to its potential for widespread harm and the ease with which sex offenders can create and disseminate such imagery.\nCrypto Scammers Exploit Gaza Crisis, Deceiving Users in Donation Scam\nCybersecurity researchers at Abnormal Security have uncovered a deceptive new crypto donation scam exploiting the humanitarian crisis in Gaza where scammers trick users by generating sympathy for Palestinian children to request donations. Around 212 individuals across 88 organizations have become targets of this charity attack.\nThreat actors like to capitalize on geopolitical events as trapping people and gaining sympathy becomes easier. We witnessed the same in the case of the missing Malaysian flight MH370, how scammers propagated fake videos and images, falsely claiming that the missing jet was found in the Bermuda Triangle. In reality, they exploited the incident to spread malicious links.\nIn the latest fraud campaign, scammers send emails that are apparently sent by a group called “help-palestinecom.” The sender urges the recipients to contribute to their campaign to support Palestinian families. \nIt is worth noting that scammers ask for donations in cryptocurrency ranging from $100 to $5000 and include cryptocurrency wallet addresses for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin to avoid being tracked.\nUnsuspecting users fall for the lure and donate, thinking that this money would help provide Palestinian children with basic needs such as medical care, clean water, and internet access. \nTo enhance the email’s legitimacy, the scammers have included links to three of the latest news articles on the impact of the conflict on children. Moreover, they have strategically used emotionally stirring language to emphasize the challenges of children in Palestine. \nFor instance, they used “children in Palestine face unimaginable challenges daily,” “a lifeline for these children caught in the crossfire,” and “the children in Palestine are dying.” To avoid detection, scammers have used multiple tactics, including spoofing the email address of an Indian stock brokerage firm Goodwill Wealth Management and creating a fake domain.\nAccording to Abnormal Security’s CISO and advisory author, Mike Britton, legacy secure email gateways (SEGs) fail to detect this scam because of social engineering techniques used by scammers and the absence of apparent indicators such as grammatical errors or payloads. Britton emphasized the need for AI-based email security solutions that could distinguish between malicious and genuine content.\n“AI-powered email security platform is trained to identify social engineering tactics, it recognizes that this email is attempting to leverage emotional manipulation to convince the target to bypass rational thinking and quickly transfer funds. It can also detect and flag the mismatch between the sender’s email and the reply-to address, as this is a common attack tactic,” Britton explained.\nThe scam is the latest to join the manipulative attacks exploiting ongoing geopolitical crises. The FBI issued warnings on 6 and 14 November 2023 to alert users about fraudsters attempting to exploit the war in Gaza. \nThe bureau highlighted that fraudsters can use emails, social media, cold calls, crowdfunding sites, and charities\/fundraisers to solicit payments. FBI warnings noted that apart from opportunistic cybercriminals, terrorist organizations can also establish fake charities to “subsidize their operations.” \nUsers are, therefore, advised to exercise caution and verify the legitimacy of the sender and their claims before donating.\nMultimillion-Dollar Vishing Scam Busted: Czech-Ukrainian Gang Arrested\nUkrainian and Czech police under the supervision of Europol have dismantled a criminal gang that stole millions of dollars from bank customers in Czechia through vishing scams. According to Europol’s press release, the police also arrested ten suspects (aged 18-29) in connection with the multimillion-dollar fraud ring.\nA joint investigation was initiated by Europol that led to the arrest of four individuals in Czechia and six in Ukraine in April 2023. Those arrested from Ukraine were later extradited to Czechia. \nDuring the crackdown, investigators seized SIM cards, mobile phones, and computer equipment from the suspects’ vehicles, call centers, residences, and offices located in Czechia (Domazlice, Rokycany, and Plzen) and Ukraine (Dnipropetrovsk). Some of the suspects had a history of drug offences, violent crimes, and document forgery.\nThe criminal organization, based in Ukraine, conducted vishing attacks against Czech victims. They operated from call centers in Ukraine and called bank customers using spoofed phone numbers, posing as bank security officers. This scamming method is called vishing (created by combining voice and phishing).\nThe targets were told that their bank account was hacked and lured into revealing their banking data, such as credit card numbers, login credentials, and other details. Scammers also made phone calls pretending to be a police official to confirm the hacking. \nAfter gaining trust, the scammers persuaded their victims to transfer funds from their “compromised” bank accounts to “safe” bank accounts, which the scammers owned. Through these scams, the fraudsters made approximately $8.7 million (€8 million) from victims in Czechia alone.\nThe Czech Republic police uncovered this scam. In November 2021, they contacted Eurojust to launch an investigation. Europol then formed a joint investigation team in June 2022, comprising Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) officials and the Czech and Ukrainian investigators. The agency organized five meetings to facilitate judicial cooperation between the authorities.\nThe police called the gang’s activities one of the “most extensive series of frauds committed through fake bankers.” Currently, Europol is conducting analytical work and providing digital forensic support for the confiscated equipment.\nVishing fraud has become more widespread and popular lately. It usually involves someone pretending to be from a reputable organization, institution, or government agency and deceiving people into disclosing confidential, personal data. \nThe severity of vishing scams is highlighted by the September 2023 incident when the notorious ALPHV (BlackCat) ransomware gang exploited vishing to deceive an MGM Resorts employee, enabling them to breach the company’s security and compromise its network.\nTo protect yourself from such scams, always be cautious of unsolicited phone calls, note the caller’s phone number, and tell them you will call back and quickly verify their identity by calling the organization. \nDon’t believe any caller if they have basic information about you because it could be taken from social media. Lastly, keep your credit\/ debit card PIN or online banking password private because bank representatives would never ask for this information.\nLockBit Affiliate Sentenced to 4 Years in Canada, Faces Extradition\nA Russian-Canadian citizen, Mikhail Vasiliev, has been sentenced to nearly four years in prison for his involvement in the notorious LockBit ransomware operation. Vasiliev will also pay $860,000 in restitution to his Canadian victims.\nVasiliev’s lawyer reportedly argued that he turned to cybercrime due to financial difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, Justice Michelle Fuerst rejected this justification, calling Vasiliev a Cyber Terrorist whose actions were motivated by greed and his crimes were “far from victimless crimes.”\nInvestigations revealed Vasiliev’s role as a key member of the LockBit ransomware gang, involved in a significant number of cyberattacks with ransom demands ranging between €5m-€70 million. Vasiliev took responsibility for his actions, as confirmed by his lawyer Louis Strezos.\nVasiliev, 34, was arrested in October 2022 from his residence in Bradford, Ontario where he had moved from Moscow 20 years ago. He pleaded guilty in February 2024 to stealing victims’ computer data and using it for extortion. \nMoreover, according to Canadian media reports, he admitted targeting at least three Canadian organizations, encrypting their data, and seeking ransom payments between 2021-2022, making $100 million in ransom demands for the gang from around 1,000 cyberattacks on victims in the U.S. and globally,\nVasiliev primarily targeted businesses in Saskatchewan, Montreal, and Newfoundland. His attacks likely caused significant disruptions and financial losses to the targeted businesses.\nIn November 2022, the US Department of Justice announced separate charges for his involvement in LockBit attacks. Vasiliev is set to be extradited to the U.S. for facing these additional charges\nLockBit, active since 2020, operates under a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) business model, where affiliates exploit intrusions and deploy ransomware in exchange for some percentage of ransom payment. \nIn 2023, the gang gained significant profits from targeting companies like Boeing and Allen & Overy and exploited the Citrix bleed security flaw tracked as CVE-2023-4966 (CVSS score: 9.4).\nLockBit’s infrastructure was dismantled by the law enforcement authorities in February 2024 as part of Operation Cronos with the seizure of 34 servers and 200 cryptocurrency accounts. Just a week after its seizure, LockBit reemerged with new leak sites, but RaaS is unlikely to recover. It claimed Operation Cronos was successful due to its negligence in updating PHP settings.\nSo far, Authorities have arrested six suspects in connection to LockBit, including Vasiliev, Ruslan Magomedovich Astamirov who was arrested in June 2023, two Russian nationals Artur Sungatov and Ivan Kondratyev, alias Bassterlord, and two others arrested in Ukraine and Poland.\nVasiliev’s potential extradition is a sign of growing international cooperation in combating cybercrime and serves as a warning to other gangs involved in such activities.\nChinese Scammers Exploit Cloned Websites in Vast Gambling Network\nOnline gambling is a booming industry, and the Asia-Pacific region has become the hub of gambling in the world, with China and India leading the way. However, this unexpected rise has led to a sharp incline in illegal activities such as money laundering, online scams, and fraud.\nIn October 2023, Hackread reported a scam campaign discovered by CloudSEK involving Chinese scammers targeting the Indian digital payment system using illegal instant loan apps. Now, an even bigger scam has come to the fore. \nAccording to Qurium Media, a Swedish nonprofit provider of digital security solutions, Chinese scammers have been creating cloned versions of legitimate websites, redirecting visitors to gambling sites.\nIt all began when MindaNews discovered a Chinese clone of their website and promptly notified Qurium. For context, MindaNews is a Philippine newspaper headquartered in Davao City and serves as the news outlet for the Mindanao Institute of Journalism.\nMindaNews’ clone (mmart-inn.com) was registered in China. It had been replicating the newspaper’s content (news, photos, opinion pieces) illegally after translating it into Chinese for the past two years, the most recent translation being of content from February 2023.\n“Some MindaNews authors were retained in their English names, while others were translated into Chinese. However, in general, the content is the same when translated to English,” explained MindaNews in its blog post.\nThe company dug deeper and found more than 500 cloned websites, many of which were of academic institutions, and all were promoting gambling services based in China. \nIt is important to note that in August 2023, the Chinese APT group Bronze Starlight was reported to be using stolen Ivacy VPN certificates to sign malware targeting the Southeast Asian gambling sector. However, as of now, it remains unclear if that attack campaign was related to the ongoing website cloning attack.\nThe cloned websites were hosted on two \/24 networks operated by the US-based, Eonix Corporation-owned ServerHub and included websites from public libraries, universities, and private businesses. \nAll the clones were created in September 2021 and promoted a gambling platform called ‘188bet’ (520xingyun.com\/from\/188bet.php) through advertisements. \nThese ads contained a physical address in the Isle of Man, where many other gambling firms (including Kaiyun, BetVictor, Raybet, or Manbetx) were already registered. A website 520xingyun{.}com was hosting a large number of such ads.\nMoreover, all the companies were registered in July 2021 through the domain registrar Gname.com Pte. LTD, employing a white-label partnership with TGP Europe and Cube Limited. Both Cube Limited and 188bet have affiliations with the Isle of Man.\nThese companies served as intermediaries from Asian gaming partners. Further probing revealed that TGP Europe was based in the UK and was found guilty of social responsibility failures and anti-money laundering. \nAccording to Qurium’s report, Gname was involved in different WIPO cases of domains used for ads. It is worth noting that 188bet has officers in Makati, Philippines, which is a standard practice. \nSo far, ServerHub has not taken any action against the client for cloning hundreds of websites, as it is still investigating the claims. As the report develops, Hackread.com will monitor the situation and provide updates to readers accordingly.\nOperator of Major Proxy Botnet ‘IPStorm’ Arrested, Pleads Guilty in US\nA Russian-Moldovan national has pleaded guilty to operating an illegal botnet proxy service called IPStorm, responsible for infecting thousands of internet-connected devices worldwide. \nSergei Makinin, 32, of Moscow, Russia, was arrested by the F.B.I. with the cooperation of law enforcement authorities in Spain and Bitdefender, which provided cybersecurity consulting, resources, and guidance to track the suspect.\nMakinin pleaded guilty to “three counts of violating 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(A) Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Computers,” in a district court in Puerto Rico as per the U.S. Department of Justice press release.\nMakinin was suspected of running an extensive botnet-for-rent operation called Interplanetary Storm (IPStorm) used for illegal activities from June 2019 through December 2022. Bitdefender first documented the operation in a research paper in October 2020.\nThe botnet targeted Windows, Linux, Mac, and Android devices and claimed victims in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. IPStorm anonymized its users’ internet traffic, allowing them to conduct malicious activities such as hacking, identity theft, and fraud.\nThe IPStorm malware allowed Makinin hijack the devices and use them as a proxy. Cybercriminals preferred the service because it was inexpensive, easy to use, and effectively anonymized their internet traffic. Makinin also admitted to developing\/distributing malware for infecting the devices, earning $550,0000, and laundering the money.\nMakinin is the first to be charged in connection with IPStorm. He faces up to 10 years in prison and will have to forfeit the cryptocurrency wallets linked with the scam. The sentencing is yet to be scheduled. Meanwhile, the F.B.I. and DoJ will continue to investigate the service.\nCommenting on this development is the operation’s lead researcher and Bitdefender’s Investigation and Forensics Unit’s senior director, Alexandru Catalin Cosoi. Cosoi shared with Hackread.com that IPStorm was a “complex” botnet rented by cybercriminals for various nefarious activities:\n“The Interplanetary Storm botnet was complex and used to power various cybercriminal activities by renting it as a proxy as a service system over infected IoT devices. Our initial research back in 2020 uncovered valuable clues to the culprit behind its operation, and we are extremely pleased it helped lead to arrests,” Cosio explained. \n“This investigation is another primary example of law enforcement and the private cybersecurity sector working together to shut down illegal online activities and bring those responsible to justice.”\nMakinin’s conviction is a significant victory for law enforcement in the fight against cybercrime. Botnet proxy services remain a serious threat because they are used to committing cybercrimes. This development sends a strong message to other cybercriminals that they will be held accountable for their actions sooner or later.\nMalicious Abrax666 AI Chatbot Exposed as Potential Scam\nAs of late October 2023, cybercriminals have been advertising a new malicious AI chatbot called Abrax666 on the dark web and underground hacking forums. The developer of the Abrax666 AI chatbot has been boasting about the chatbot claiming it to be a perfect multitasking tool for ethical and unethical activities.\nCurrently, the pricing structure of the Abrax666 AI chatbot is €299 per month, and €2499 per year, while its source code is available for sale for €4999, however, according to cybersecurity researchers at SlashNext, the Abrax666 chatbot is likely to be fake, and could be an attempt to scam buyers.\nIt is worth noting that after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot, cybercriminals attempted to exploit it for malicious purposes. In particular, Russian hackers tried to leverage the chatbot to create malware and phishing pages. While there was some success, to escalate their efforts, cybercriminals launched their own malicious chatbots, including WormGPT and FraudGPT.\nIn the latest report, SlashNext’s cybersecurity researcher Daniel Kelley highlighted several red flags indicating how the Abrax666 AI chatbot could be a scam despite the big claims. The chatbot is being sold by a threat actor using the alias Abrax on a notorious Russian-language forum where the rule of sale includes sellers depositing some amount of money to initiate the sales process. \nHowever, Abrax not only did not deposit the funds but also refused to allow interested parties to review the chatbot before making a purchase. One potential buyer using the alias ‘SocketSilence’ stated that Abrax failed to provide any evidence of whether they have sold the chatbot previously or if it actually works.\nDespite video demonstrations shared by the seller, the authenticity of the chatbot’s capabilities remains in question. The videos, according to Kelley, do not exhibit standard AI chatbot behaviour and appear more like a standard tool.\n“The only potentially credible evidence that has caused us to slightly defer our verdict here, are videos being circulated by ‘Abrax’ that allegedly show the AI chatbot in use,” Daniel explained in a blog post. \n“However, even these videos do not appear to showcase the standard output one would expect from an AI chatbot of this nature. The output appears to look more like a standard tool that is not capable of real-time communication and does not accept prompts but arguments and flags instead,” the researcher added.\nAbrax’s attempt to sell the chatbot on other cybercrime forums resulted in the removal of the threat, possibly due to administrators detecting malicious intent. Furthermore, the topic initiated by Abrax was locked by forum administrators at the time of writing. \nOverall, the SlashNext report casts doubt on the legitimacy of the Abrax666 AI chatbot, cautioning potential buyers against its advertised capabilities. However, if the seller provides evidence that their product is legitimate and aligns with the claims they have made, it could likely change the minds of researchers.\nBeware the Blur: Phishing Scam Drops Byakugan Malware via Fake PDF\nCybersecurity firm Fortinet alerts users of a phishing scam campaign distributing the Byakugan malware. This malware steals sensitive information and grants attackers remote access to infected Windows devices.\nIn January 2024, FortiGuard Labs discovered a PDF file in Portuguese language distributing Byakugan, a multi-functional malware. Researchers found a blurred table in the PDF and instructions for the victims to click a malicious link to view the content. \nOnce clicked, the downloader drops a file titled require.exe, which is its copy. Then a clean installer is downloaded to the temp folder followed by a DLL, which is executed via DLL-hijacking to run require.exe to download the main module. \nThe downloader, named “require.exe” and located in the temp folder, executes the copy and not the Reader_Install_Setup.exe, and exhibits different behaviour in both files. Byakugan’s main module is downloaded from thinkforce.com, a C2 server that may also serve as an attacker’s control panel, with a login page on port 8080.\nAhnLab SEcurity Intelligence Center (ASEC) also discovered an Infostealer disguised as an Adobe Reader installer through a fake PDF file in Portuguese, urging users to download Adobe Reader, which led to the execution of a malicious file Reader_Install_Setup.exe. \nIt further creates two malicious files and runs a Windows system file, msdt.exe as an administrator, loading the malicious BluetoothDiagnosticUtil.dll and loading the malicious DLL file. The threat actor can bypass User Account Control (UAC) via DLL hijacking. \nByakugan is a node.js-based malware that uses OBS Studio to monitor the target’s desktop and perform various functions. It has several libraries, including a screen monitor, miner, keylogger, file manipulation, and browser information stealer. \nMoreover, Byakugan can choose between mining with CPU or GPU to prevent system overloading and downloads from popular miners like Xmrig, t-rex, and NBMiner. It also stores data in the kl folder and can steal information about “cookies, credit cards, downloads, and auto-filled profiles,” researchers wrote.\nByakugan also has anti-analysis features, such as pretending to be a memory manager and setting the path to the Windows Defender’s exclusion path. Additionally, it drops a task scheduler configuration file into the Defender folder, enabling it to execute automatically when starting up. However, this newer variant does not download the software from its domain.\nThreat actors are using both clean and malicious components in malware, such as Byakugan, making detection difficult, FortiGuard researchers noted, Therefore, to stay protected from phishing attacks and such deceptive malware, users must be cautious with emails, and verify sender legitimacy.\nAdditionally, use strong passwords and two-factor authentication, keep software updated, and prefer installing security software that can detect and block phishing emails\/malware. Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails, and contacting the sender directly.\nDropbox Abused in New Phishing, Malspam Scam to Steal SaaS Logins\nCybersecurity firm Darktrace is warning users about a notorious new phishing and Malspam campaign targeting customers of popular Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platforms by exploiting Dropbox emails.\nCambridge, UK-based cybersecurity firm Darktrace’s latest research reveals a new Dropbox phishing attack successfully bypassing MFA (multi-factor authentication) protocols. This exploit aims to trick users into downloading malware and exposing their login credentials.\nIt’s been observed that attackers send seemingly harmless emails originating from a legitimate Dropbox address, containing a malicious link. On January 25, 2024, researchers detected a suspicious email sent to 16 internal users of the Darktrace SaaS environment, originating from a legitimate email address- ‘no-reply@dropboxcom’. \nThe email contained a link to a PDF file hosted on Dropbox, possibly named after a Dropbox partner organization. The PDF file contained a suspicious link to a domain named ‘mmv-securitytop.’ Darktace’s email security tool detected and held the email, but a user received another email from a legitimate no-reply@dropboxcom on January 29, requesting to open the previously shared PDF file.\n“Darktrace\/Email moved the email to the user’s junk file and applied a lock link action to prevent the user from directly following a potentially malicious link,” but couldn’t prevent the damage because an employee clicked on the link.\nNext, the user’s device got connected to a malicious endpoint, ‘mmv-securitytop’, leading to a fake Microsoft 365 login page. These credential harvesters, disguised as trusted organizations like Microsoft, increase the likelihood of stealing privileged SaaS account credentials. \nSince January 31, Darktrace observed suspicious SaaS activity, including logins from unusual locations and endpoints associated with ExpressVPN, suggesting threat actors are using a VPN to mask their true location.\nAn interesting finding was that threat actors bypassed a customer’s MFA policy using valid tokens and meeting authentication requirements. An additional login was observed from 87.117.225155, using the HideMyAss VPN service. \nAccording to Darktrace’s blog post, the actor created a new email rule, ‘….’, to move emails to the ‘Conversation History’ mailbox folder, a tactic used by threat actors during phishing campaigns. This generic name helps maintain undetected activity on target networks.\nDropbox exploitation is gaining popularity among threat actors, as it is difficult to detect foul play because emails are sent from legitimate addresses. In September 2023, Hackread.com reported a BEC 3.0 attack campaign leveraging Dropbox to send emails redirecting users to credential-harvesting pages.\nClicking on malicious links in phishing emails can lead to malware infections, stealing of sensitive data, and compromising login credentials. In business settings, a single employee’s account can allow attackers to access the entire SaaS environment, thereby disrupting operations.\nWhile relying on common sense is typically the best defence against such attacks, scammers’ increasing sophistication can sometimes override our natural caution. Therefore, it’s crucial to proactively protect yourself. Here are 5 key points to help you recognize and safeguard against email phishing:\nSuspicious Sender Addresses and Email Content:\nMalicious Links and Attachments:\nPhishing for Information:\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Strong Passwords:\nStaying Informed and Reporting Phishing Attempts:\nTycoon and Storm-1575 Linked to Phishing Attacks on US Schools\nPublic schools across the United States are facing a surge in sophisticated phishing campaigns, according to a new report by PIXM, a cybersecurity firm specializing in artificial intelligence solutions. \nThreat actors launch targeted spear phishing attacks using stealthy attack patterns to target officials at large US school districts, bypassing MFA protections.\nThe report highlights a worrying trend: attackers are increasingly employing tactics to bypass Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), a security measure previously thought to offer robust protection. \nSince December 2023, a surge in MFA-based phishing campaigns targeting US teachers, staff, and administrators has been observed, using dadsec and Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) platforms to compromise administrator email accounts and deliver ransomware, researchers noted.\nPIXM discovered phishing activity in November 2023 and linked it to Tycoon and Storm-1575 threat groups. These groups were singled out because of their common attack pattern. Both actors use social engineering techniques, spoofing emails to appear legitimate and using AiTM (Adversary-in-the-Middle) phishing to bypass MFA tokens and session cookies. \nThey also create customized login experiences and use dadsec and phisingkit PhaaS services to point at legitimate sites. Their infrastructure, including C2 servers, domain generation algorithms, legitimate hosting services, and SSL certificates, allows them to control large numbers of phishing websites and avoid detection.\nFor your information, The Tycoon Group’s PaaS, available on Telegram for just $120, boasts key features like bypassing Microsoft’s two-factor authentication. On the other hand, Microsoft identifies Storm-1575 as a threat actor engaging in phishing campaigns through the Dadsec platform. They employ numerous Domain Generated Algorithm domains to host credential harvesting pages, targeting global organizations to extract Microsoft 365 credentials.\nIn the attacks, as detailed by PIXM in a blog post, targeted officials received phishing emails prompting them to update passwords. This led to encountering a Cloudflare Captcha and a spoofed Microsoft password page. If unthwarted, attackers would forward passwords to legitimate login pages, requesting two-factor authentication codes, and bypassing MFA protections. \nCommon targets include the Chief of Human Capital and multiple finance and payroll administrator accounts. Some attacks attempted to alter Windows registry keys, potentially infecting machines with malicious scripts. The attacks concealed their tracks using stealth tactics like hiding behind Cloudflare infrastructure and spinning up new domains.\nThe use of CAPTCHAs in phishing attacks can delay the delivery of the payload and provide a sense of legitimacy to end users. However, there is also a potential for malicious trojan activity, such as modifying Windows registry keys for the VBS file format and injecting a malicious file’script.vbs’. These attacks can be used for malware installation, ransomware, and data exfiltration. \nWhile schools are the most targeted industry by ransomware gangs, student data has also been a prominent prey of cybercrime, but the extensiveness of data loss noticed recently is unprecedented. It is estimated that over 900 schools were targeted in MOVEit-linked cyber attacks.\nA data leak involving Raptor Technologies in January 202, reported by cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler, exposed around 4,024,001 sensitive records belonging to students, parents, and staff, raising concerns about student privacy and school safety. \nJust one month later, in February 2024, Fowler discovered a non-password-protected database storing 210,020 records or 153.76 GB of data, containing sensitive information like full names, addresses, phone numbers, and tax records of students and parents, associated with the Online Voucher Application.\nTo protect against such phishing attacks, organizations should identify high-priority staff with sensitive access or regular communication patterns, invest in tailored awareness efforts, arm users with caution against links and websites prompting MFA tokens and CAPTCHAs, and implement proactive AI-driven protections at the browser and email layers.\nNew Latrodectus Downloader Malware Linked to IcedID and Qbot Creators\nCybersecurity researchers at Proofpoint have identified a new malware threat dubbed “Latrodectus.” First observed in November 2023, Latrodectus is a downloader malware used by cybercriminals to gain initial access to victim systems and deploy further malicious payloads.\nThis malware poses a major threat due to its ability to evade detection techniques commonly employed in sandboxes, which are security environments used to analyze suspicious code.\nInitial analysis suggested Latrodectus might be a variant of the notorious IcedID malware. However, further investigation revealed it to be an entirely new strain, likely created by the same developers behind IcedID. This connection is supported by shared infrastructure and code characteristics.\nProofpoint report shared with Hackread.com on Thursday 04, 2024 ahead of publication on Tuesday attributes Latrodectus to two specific threat actors: TA577 and TA578. It is worth mentioning that TA578 is known for delivering malware threats like BazaLoader, Cobalt Strike, Ursnif, and KPOT Stealer.\nOn the other hand, TA577 is infamous for having served as a key affiliate of the Qbot network until its recent disruption. TA577 has been linked by Proofpoint to various campaigns, with subsequent ransomware infections such as Black Basta being notably attributed to them.  \nThese actors are classified as Initial Access Brokers (IABs), specializing in gaining initial footholds within victim networks. Latrodectus serves as their tool to establish a foothold and potentially deploy ransomware or other malicious tools.\nCommenting on this, Ken Dunham, Cyber Threat Director at Qualys Threat Research Unit told Hackread.com, “Battling eCrime is similar to moving a couch where roaches live, they simply run to another piece of furniture or room nearby to seek harbour and continue business as normal, despite any actions taken by the homeowner.“ \n“Latrodectus has powerful components upon its emergence, capable of defeating sandboxes, use of RC4 encrypted command and control communications, and more,“ Ken warned. “It appears likely that actors behind QBot felt the heat from takedowns last year, migrating to this new code base and infrastructure in the fall of 2023.“\nWhile Latrodectus activity dropped in December 2023 and January 2024, Proofpoint reports a surge in campaigns throughout February and March 2024. This suggests a growing adoption of Latrodectus by cybercriminals.\nThe specific payloads delivered by Latrodectus remain unknown, but its downloader functionality allows attackers to deploy a wide range of tools through malicious emails depending on their objectives.\nWhile technical details of Latrodectus’s modus operandi are available in Proofpoint’s blog post, here are some to mitigate the risk of Latrodectus:\nResearchers Test Zero-click Worms that Exploit Generative AI Apps\nResearchers have recently unveiled findings indicating the creation of a computer worm capable of targeting generative AI-powered applications. This revelation comes amidst growing concerns over the security of artificial intelligence systems.\nIn a collaborative effort led by Stav Cohen from Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, Ron Bitton from Intuit, and Ben Nassi from Cornell Tech, the team developed and tested this novel worm against popular AI models, including Gemini Pro (previously Bard AI), ChatGPT, and LLaVA. \nWhile the study highlights the potential malicious applications of such technology, it also echoes a warning issued last year by Europol regarding prompt engineering and jailbreaking of AI chatbots.\nThe research suggests that attackers could exploit this worm to manipulate AI models into replicating malicious inputs and engaging in harmful activities. One alarming demonstration involved the worm attacking generative AI email assistants, effectively stealing email data and distributing spam.\nThe mechanism behind the worm’s operation is intriguing yet concerning. By introducing specific text into an email, attackers could “poison” the databases of certain email application clients. This manipulation could then prompt models like ChatGPT and Gemini to replicate the malicious input and extract sensitive user data from the context.\nIn their study dubbed ComPromptMized, the researchers explored various scenarios, including both black-box and white-box accesses, and tested the worm’s effectiveness against different types of input data, such as text and images. The findings underscore the potential threats posed by such attacks on the burgeoning GenAI ecosystems.\nThe implications of this research extend beyond theoretical concerns. As more companies integrate generative AI capabilities into their applications, the risk of exploitation becomes increasingly tangible. The ability of malicious actors to leverage AI technology for nefarious purposes underscores the urgent need for robust security measures in AI development and deployment.\nBeth Linker, Senior Director of AI & SAST at the Synopsys Software Integrity Group, emphasized the significance of this research, stating, “This attack highlights the vulnerability of GenAI-powered proactive agents as a potential target for exploitation. With the proliferation of new AI-driven tools promising to streamline our digital interactions, it is crucial for organizations to carefully consider the permissions granted to these tools and implement robust safety measures.”\nWhile the research provides valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of generative AI systems, it also serves as a call to action for stakeholders across various industries. As we continue to embrace the benefits of AI innovation, it is imperative to remain alert against emerging threats and prioritize the development of strong security protocols.\nNew CHAVECLOAK Banking Trojan Targets Brazilians via Malicious PDFs\nCybersecurity researchers at FortiGuard Labs have discovered a high-severity Trojan, dubbed CHAVECLOAK, targeting Brazilian banking users. The malware targets Windows devices and accesses online banking platforms, stealing their banking credentials and financial information.\nThe CHAVECLOAK infection method is under investigation, but researchers suspect potential distribution channels include phishing emails, SMS phishing, and compromised websites. \nAccording to the company’s blog post, the campaign involves malicious emails disguised as legitimate bank communications that could trick users into downloading malware. It then targets unsuspecting users utilising Portuguese language settings, DLL sideloading, and deceptive pop-ups. It actively monitors victims’ interactions with financial portals. \nIt is worth motioning that DLL sideloading poses a huge security risk because it allows the malware to exploit legitimate processes without raising suspicion or getting detected. \nThe malware controls victims’ devices and collects sensitive financial information through a malicious PDF file, claiming to contain contract documents with Portuguese instructions. However, it has a malicious downloader link, which is processed via Goo.su and redirects to a ZIP file, resulting in the MSI file “NotafiscalGFGJKHKHGUURTURTF345.msi.” \nWhen decompressed, the MSI installer revealed multiple TXT files, a legitimate execution file, and a malicious DLL named “Lightshot.dll.” The DLL file’s modified date is more recent than the other files. The installer executes the file “Lightshot.exe” and uses DLL sideloading techniques to execute the malicious DLL. This lets the legitimate executable run the malicious code discreetly, enabling unauthorized activities like data theft. \nAdditionally, the malware uses the “GetVolumeInformationW” process to gather file system and volume information, generates a log file, and executes the “Lightshot.exe” program upon user login. It sends HTTP requests, logs data, and monitors the foreground window using the APIs “GetForegroundWindow” and “GetWindowTextW.” \nThe malware then communicates with its C2 server, facilitating actions to steal a victim’s credentials, blocking their screen, logging keystrokes, and displaying deceptive pop-up windows. \nFurther, it actively monitors access to financial portals, including Mercado Bitcoin, the largest digital currency exchange in Brazil and Latin America, which combines conventional and cryptocurrency platforms and traditional banks.\nThe stolen information is uploaded to different paths. The malware configures account information and sends a POST request. The malware actively monitors victims’ interactions with financial portals, highlighting the sophistication of contemporary banking trojans.\nTo protect yourself from CHAVECLOAK and similar banking trojans, be cautious with emails and SMS, verify website legitimacy, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), use strong passwords, and regularly update your operating system, web browser, and security software to address known vulnerabilities. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or attachments, and double-check website URLs for typos or minor variations.\nNew Bifrost RAT Variant Targets Linux Devices, Mimics VMware Domain\nCybersecurity experts at Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 have uncovered a new cybersecurity threat: a new variant of the Bifrost RAT (also known as Bifrose) targeting Linux systems. This variant, utilizing a tricky domain named download.vmfare(.)com, is designed to evade detection and compromise targeted systems.\nThe malicious domain bears a not-so-easy-to-distinguish resemblance to a legitimate VMware domain, with the only difference being the substitution of the letter “F” for the “W” in the domain: VMware becomes VMfare. For your information, VMware is a leading provider of virtualization and cloud computing software and services. \nThis type of attack is called a typosquatting attack in which malicious actors register domain names similar to popular ones, relying on users making typing errors to visit their sites, often for phishing or malware distribution purposes. For example, “It’s Google.com, not ɢoogle.com.”\nBifrost, a remote access Trojan (RAT) dating back to 2004, is notorious for its ability to hide within systems, inject malicious code into legitimate processes, and establish covert communication channels with external servers. This allows attackers to steal sensitive data with ease.\nThe latest version of Bifrost, as detailed by researchers in their technical blog post, employs sophisticated techniques to avoid detection and complicate efforts to trace its origins. By encrypting collected data using RC4 encryption, and the aforementioned domain with a deceptive name, the malware makes it challenging for security experts to thwart its activities. \nAdditionally, the malware’s recent deployment on a server hosting an ARM version hints at an expansion of its targets.\nAnalysis of the malware’s code reveals intricate manoeuvres to establish connections and gather data, showcasing its advanced capabilities in evading detection. Palo Alto Networks detected over 100 instances of Bifrost activity in recent months, signalling a critical need for enhanced security measures.\nTo safeguard against Bifrost attacks, Unit 42 researchers recommend a multi-faceted approach including regular system updates, strong access controls, deployment of endpoint security solutions, and vigilant monitoring of network activity. \nRussian Ministry Software Backdoored with North Korean KONNI Malware\nGerman cybersecurity firm DCSO has discovered a malware sample uploaded to VirusTotal in January 2024, believed to be part of North Korea-linked activity targeting the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MID). The malware is believed to be KONNI, a North Korean nexus tool used since 2014.\nKONNI, first discovered in 2014, is associated with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)-nexus actors like Konni Group and TA406. The malware has unique stealer functionality and remote administration capability. It’s installed in an MSI file, with C2 servers encrypted with AES-CTR, and a CustomAction for detection and payload selection. \nIn the latest discovery, researchers noted that KONNI’s command set remains unchanged, allowing operators to execute commands, upload\/download files, specify sleep intervals, communicate via HTTP, and compress file extensions into .CAB archives.\n#ShortAndMaliciousOur researchers recently discovered an installer for the mandatory 🇷🇺Russian tax filling software \"Spravki BK\" (Справки БК) which was backdoored with #KONNI malware, generally attributed to 🇰🇵North Korean threat actors. 1\/5\nInterestingly, the sample DCSO analyzed was delivered via a backdoored Russian language software installer, similar to a previously observed KONNI delivery technique. The sample was for a tool called “Statistika KZU”, which is believed to be intended for internal use within the Russian MID. The software is used for relaying annual report files from overseas consular posts to the MID’s Consular Department via a secure channel.\nAdditionally, two user manuals were found in the backdoored installer, detailing the installation and usage of the “Statistika KZU” program. The first manual explains installing the program on an administrative account, providing minimum software requirements and screenshots. \nThe second 22-pager manual, “StatRKZU_Pyкoвoдcтвo,” outlines how to use the software for generating annual report files on KZU consular activities, including templates for calculating registered and detained citizens.\nThe MID’s software, identified as “GosNIIAS” (a Russian federal research institute primarily involved in aerospace research), was tested offline and found legitimate. Despite no direct correlations between GosNIIAS and Statistika KZU, references to contracts were found, including a procurement order for automated system maintenance and data protection software.\nThis discovery comes amid increasing geopolitical proximity between Russia and the DPRK, following Russia’s renewed invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nThis is not the first time Russia and North Korea have made collective headlines over cybersecurity threats. In August 2023, the world witnessed another significant incident when “elite North Korean hackers” affiliated with OpenCarrot and the Lazarus group breached NPO Mashinostroyeniya, a key Russian missile developer. This breach, lasting for at least five months, revealed the alarming capabilities and determination of the attackers.\nKONNI has been used in many cyberespionage campaigns targeting Russian agencies. FortiGuard Labs discovered a KONNI malware campaign in November 2023, targeting Windows systems through Word documents with malicious macros. Malwarebytes researchers discovered a campaign in mid-2021 using Russian language lures concerning Russian-Korean trade and economic issues and a meeting of a Russian-Mongolian intergovernmental commission.\nAn unknown hacking group targeted North Korean organizations using KONNI Malware in 2017. Three campaigns were identified back then- two by Talos Intelligence, a Cisco-owned cybersecurity firm, and the third reported by Cylance security firm.\nFor insights into this, we reached out to John Bambenek, President at Bambenek Consulting,  who emphasised that “It is not uncommon for intelligence agencies to spy even on their putative allies, if for nothing else, for insights to either strengthen the relationship or to identify and mitigate threats.”\nMr. Bambenek highlighted that “The use of a backdoor in software used almost exclusively by the Russian Foreign Ministry stands out and shows that the DPRK did their research here for a particular hook into their victims and is, ironically, a more targeted and precise adaptation of the approach Russian intelligence used with NotPetya.”\n“Espionage has a couple of nuances where sometimes you want more sophisticated tools and for some attacks, you want narrow and simpler tools. For espionage, you want long-term persistent infection and sophisticated and interactive tools provide defenders more opportunities for detection. It’s not uncommon to see tools used for espionage that lack some of the obfuscation commonly observed in cybercrime tools,” he added.\nNew Linux Malware “Migo” Exploits Redis for Cryptojacking, Disables Security\nA sophisticated Linux malware campaign has been discovered targeting Redis, a popular data store system, to gain initial access using “System Weakening Commands,” revealed Cado Security Labs.\nCado researchers disclosed that the malware, dubbed Migo, exploits Redis for cryptojacking. The attackers execute commands on their target’s Redis servers to disable configuration options and make them vulnerable before deploying the payload. \nThe primary payload, Migo, is a Golang ELF binary that retrieves an XMRig installer from GitHub. Redis system weakening commands are used to disable configuration options, such as protected mode and replica-read-only, using CLI commands to execute malicious payloads from external sources like Pastebin to mine cryptocurrency in the background.\nFor your information, Protected mode is a Redis server operating mode introduced in version 3.2.0 to mitigate potential network exposure. It only accepts connections from the loopback interface and is likely disabled at initial access to allow attackers to send additional commands.\nConversely, the replica-read-only feature in Redis prevents accidental writes to replicas that may result in out-of-sync. Cado researchers report exploitation of this feature for malicious payload delivery, with Migo attackers likely disabling it for future Redis server exploitation.\nMigo uses compile-time obfuscation and a user-mode rootkit ‘libprocesshider,’ to hide processes and artefacts, making it difficult for security analysts to detect and mitigate the threat. Once the miner is installed, Migo sets XMRig’s configuration to query system information, including logged-in users and resource limits.\n“It also sets the number of Huge Pages available on the system to 128, using the vm.nr_hugepages parameter. These actions are fairly typical for cryptojacking malware,” Matt Muir, Cado Security’s security researcher noted in a blog post.\nIt executes shell commands to copy the binary, disable SELinux, identify uninstallation scripts, execute the miner, kill competing processes, register persistence, and prevent outbound traffic to specific IP addresses and domains.\nMoreover, Migo relies on systemd service and timer for persistence and the developers have obfuscated symbols and strings in the pclntab structure to complicate the malware analysis process. The involvement of a user-mode rootkit also complicates post-incident forensics of compromised hosts, and libprocesshider hides on-disk artefacts.\nMigo’s emergence shows that cloud-focused attackers are continually refining their techniques and focused on exploiting web-facing services. They used Redis system weakening commands to disable security features, a move not previously reported in campaigns exploiting Redis for initial access, researchers concluded.\nNew MonikerLink Flaw Exposes Outlook Users to Data Theft and Malware\nCheck Point Research (CPR) has discovered a critical security flaw in Microsoft Outlook. Dubbed the #MonikerLink; the vulnerability allows threat actors to execute arbitrary code on their targeted device. The research, detailed in a blog post, highlights the flaw’s potential to exploit the way Outlook processes certain hyperlinks.\nThe exploit is tracked as CVE-2024-21413 with a CVSS score of 9.8 out of 10, which means the vulnerability has critical severity and is highly exploitable, possibly allowing an attacker to compromise the system with minimal user interaction. This could lead to complete system compromise, denial of service, and data breach. Furthermore, an attacker could execute arbitrary code, steal data, and install malware. \nThe issue occurs due to the way Outlook processes the “file:\/\/” hyperlinks, leading to severe security implications. Threat actors can execute unauthorized code on the targeted device. CPR’s research reveals that the #MonikerLink vulnerability misuses the Component Object Model (COM) on Windows, allowing unauthorized code execution and leaking of local NTLM credential information. \nThe vulnerability exploits a user’s NTLM credentials to enable arbitrary code execution through the COM in Windows. When a user clicks on the malicious hyperlink, it connects to a remote server controlled by the attacker, compromising authentication details and potentially leading to code execution. This allows attackers to invoke COM objects and execute code on the victim’s machine remotely, bypassing the Protected View mode in Office applications.\nResearchers studied three attack vectors for MS Windows-Outlook 2021: the “obvious” Hyperlink attack vector, the “normal” attachment attack vector, and the “advanced” attack vector. The “obvious” Hyperlink attack vector involves sending emails with malicious web hyperlinks, posing security risks in browsers. \nThe “normal” attachment attack vector involves the attacker sending a malicious email and luring the victim to open the attachment. The Advanced attack vector, the Email Reading attack vector, triggers security problems when the victim reads an email on Outlook.\nMicrosoft Outlook, one of the world’s most popular Microsoft Office suite apps, has become a critical gateway for introducing cyber threats into organizations. Microsoft’s Threat Protection Intelligence team discovered a critical vulnerability (CVE-2023-23397) in Outlook in March 2023 which threat actor Forest Blizzard was exploiting to steal Net-NTLMv2 hashes and access user accounts.\nAccording to CPR’s blog post, the company has confirmed the latest vulnerability in Microsoft 365 environments and notified the Microsoft Security Response Center. Microsoft is yet to respond to the issue. Hackread.com will update readers as soon as more details are shared with the cybersecurity community.\nThis vulnerability, which extends beyond Outlook, poses a significant risk to organizational security. Both users and organizations are advised to apply patches, follow security practices, and remain vigilant against suspicious emails.\nSpyNote Android Spyware Poses as Legit Crypto Wallets, Steals Funds\nThe Android spyware SpyNote developers are now considering cryptocurrencies, extending beyond mere credentials spying to initiate cryptocurrency transfers, revealed the latest research report from FortiGuard Labs.\nResearchers noted that Spynote, a notorious Remote Access Trojan (RAT), is now targeting “famous crypto wallets” by abusing the Accessibility API. The API’s job is to automatically perform UI actions, such as recording device unlocking gestures and is mainly helpful for people with disabilities.\nThe malicious code abuses the Accessibility API to automatically fill out a form and transfer cryptocurrency to cyber criminals. It reads and memorizes the destination wallet address and amount, and replaces it with the attacker’s crypto wallet address. \nThe information is sent to a remote server with which the malware has established a connection already to complete the action. It is worth noting that the entire act is completed automatically, without alerting the user.\nAccording to Fortinet’s blog post, on 1st February, a malicious sample was found posing as a legitimate crypto wallet, incorporating SpyNote RAT and anti-analysis features. They also observed that threat actors are mainly targeting users with mobile crypto wallets or banking applications in this financially motivated, medium-severity hacking saga.\nResearchers showed screenshots in which SpyNote malware can be seen requesting Accessibility Service and the user granting access with the Android OS displaying additional warnings. It is evident that clicking on “Allow” signals the malware to perform its nefarious action whereas clicking “Deny” prevents it from gaining access.\nHackread has been following the evolution of SpyNote ever since it made its first appearance back in 2016 when Palo Alto’s Unit 42 discovered this RAT on a dark net forum mainly targeting users who install APK apps. Researchers noted that SpyNote helped attackers gain remote control of infected devices, and enabled sideloading on Android devices.\nIn 2017, Zscaler IT security researchers discovered fake apps infected with the SpyNote RAT, allowing attackers to gain remote administrative control on Android devices. Researchers identified various apps, including fake Netflix, WhatsApp, YouTube, Facebook, Photoshop, SkyTV, Hotstar, Trump Dash PokemonGo, etc., infected with a new variant of SpyNote RAT.\nOver the years, SpyNote has become a common family of Android malware, with over 10,000 samples and multiple variants, noted FortiGuard researchers. \nLast year, the malware authors shifted focus to banking fraud, as the Cleafy Threat Intelligence Team reported SpyNote targeting European financial institutions with social engineering tactics and abusing Accessibility services. The attack started with deceptive smishing campaigns, directing victims to install a “new certified banking app” and granting remote access to their devices.\nIt is worth noting that malware often lures victims into giving them the necessary rights to access the Accessibility API through different lures, posing a threat to users, especially people with disabilities. \nAndroid users are advised to pay attention to applications requesting the Accessibility API. End-users should treat these requests as suspicious, especially from alleged crypto wallets, PDF readers, and video players.\nNew TicTacToe Dropper Steals Data, Spreads Multiple Threats on Windows\nFortinet’s FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Team has identified a group of malware droppers used in delivering final-stage payloads throughout 2023. The group is named ‘TicTacToe dropper’ due to a common Polish string, ‘Kolko_i_krzyzyk’, which translates to TicTacToe in English.\nThese droppers obfuscate final payloads during load and initial execution, including Leonem, AgentTesla, SnakeLogger, LokiBot, Remcos, RemLoader, Sabsik, Taskun, Androm and Upatre.\nAccording to FortiGuard, the TicTacToe dropper has distributed multiple final-stage remote access tools (RATs) in the last 12 months and the final payloads feature several common characteristics, including multi-stage layered payloads, .NET executables\/libraries, payload obfuscation using SmartAssembly software, DLL files nesting, and reflective loading.\nIn this campaign, malware executable is typically delivered via a .iso file, a technique often used to avoid detection by antivirus software and as a mark-of-the-web bypass technique. The executable contains multiple DLL file layers, which are extracted at runtime and loaded directly into memory. \nThe medium severity level loader mainly affects Microsoft Windows platforms, potentially leading to compromised credentials and enabling further malicious activities, wrote Amey Gat and Mark Robson in FortiGuard’s blog post published on 14 February 2024.\nSamples from early 2023 contained the strings TicTacToe, while later campaigns had different strings and different final-stage payloads. This suggests the tool is constantly developing and developers are trying to evade string-based analysis.\nThe first sample was a 32-bit executable called ‘ALco.exe’, which extracts and loads a.NET PE DLL file named ‘Hadval.dll’ or ‘stage2 payload’. The file is obfuscated with DeepSea version 4.1, causing unreadable function names and code flow obfuscation. \nThe de4dot tool, an open-source (GPLv3) .NET de-obfuscator and unpacker, utilized in the attack, successfully circumvents certain DeepSea obfuscation techniques, resulting in the de-obfuscation of a significant portion of the Hadval.dll file. \nThis file is responsible for extracting a gzip blob, which, upon decompression, unveils an additional 32-bit PE DLL file and another .NET library. The stage 3 payload, internally named ‘cruiser.dll’, is protected by SmartAssembly software.\nThe cruiser.dll file contained a class named ‘Munoz’ that creates a copy of the executable in the temp folder. The code from stage 3 extracts, loads, and executes the stage 4 payload from the bitmap object ‘dZAu’. Another DLL file, ‘Farinell2.dll’, is obfuscated with a custom obfuscator.\nA separate TicTacToe dropper sample was earlier analyzed, which dropped AgentTesla, a well-known RAT. This 32-bit.NET executable used an identical technique to load code stored in the resource element of the file. \nThe stage 2 payload had the internal name ‘Pendulum.dll’ and the stage 3 payload had the name ‘cruiser.dll.’ The stage 3 payload extracted the stage 4 payload from the bitmap object ‘faLa’ with the final payload being AgentTesla.\nFor mitigating the threat, researchers believe hash-based detections are effective for known campaigns. However, a behaviour-based endpoint security tool is required for new campaigns given the dynamic nature of this malware. EDR technology like FortiEDR can effectively detect anomalous behaviour.\nNew iOS Trojan “GoldPickaxe” Steals Facial Recognition Data\nGroup-IB has discovered a new iOS Trojan, dubbed GoldPickaxe.iOS designed to steal facial recognition data, identity documents, and intercept SMS. The company’s Threat Intelligence Unit has attributed the entire threat cluster to a threat actor dubbed GoldFactory. \nThe GoldPickaxe family has been active since mid-2023, targeting the Asia-Pacific region, specifically Thailand and Vietnam and the attack method involves impersonating local banks and government organizations.\nAs per Group-IB, the threat actor exploits stolen biometric data using AI-driven face-swapping services to create deepfakes, allowing unauthorized access to a victim’s banking account, which is a new monetary theft technique.\nIn this campaign, GoldFactory has successfully used Mobile Device Management (MDM) to manipulate Apple devices, distributing its iOS Trojan by abusing TestFlight. Victims receive seemingly innocent URLs (e.g. testflight.apple.com\/join\/) leading to the installation of malicious software. \nAnother sophisticated method is tricking victims into interacting with fraudulent websites to install an MDM profile, allowing cybercriminals complete control over the victim’s device.\nThailand Banking Sector CERT (TB-CERT) has also reported that cybercriminals are distributing malicious links via messengers to lure victims into a fraudulent app posing as a ‘Digital Pension’ app. The app’s credibility is doubtful as Group-IB’s investigation confirmed multiple versions of GoldPickaxe impersonating official Thai government services, including the Digital Pension app for Thailand.\nResearchers believe that the group may be engaging operators proficient in Thai and Vietnamese or possibly running a call center since an SMS written in Thai was found in the phishing campaign. In Thailand, cybercriminals impersonate government authorities and convince victims to use LINE, a popular messaging application.\nAccording to Group-IB’s blog post, the gang reportedly employs a combination of smishing and phishing techniques to carry out their malicious activities in Vietnam and Thailand. Despite evidence that it is a Chinese-speaking group, the involvement\/role of local cybercriminals cannot be ruled out when calls made to victims are examined.\nIt is worth noting that Group-IB previously discovered an Android Trojan, codenamed GoldDigger, stealing facial data, targeting over 50 Vietnamese banking applications, electronic wallets, and cryptocurrency wallets since June 2023. \nThe newly discovered GoldPickaxe family is based on the GoldDigger Android Trojan. However, researchers claim the infection chain for GoldPickaxe iOS variants is not significantly different for other Trojans within the GoldFactory family.\nGoldPickaxe malware was developed using the same communication mechanism and cloud bucket URL as GoldDigger but has fewer functionalities compared to its Android sibling due to iOS’s closed nature and stricter permissions. \nBoth versions use fake login pages to access fake Digital pension applications, potentially avoiding detection. Another variant, GoldDiggerPlus, was also identified with extended GoldDigger’s functionality, allowing real-time call calls through a specially designed APK called GoldKefu. All Trojans identified are currently in the active stage of evolution.\n“Overall, we identified four Trojan families that were used by cybercriminals. We maintained the naming convention by using the prefix Gold for the newly discovered malware as a symbolic representation that they have been developed by the same threat actor,” Group-IB researchers noted.\nResearchers couldn’t identify the toolset GoldFactory uses, indicating that this is a highly organized and technically advanced group.\nFor your information, in March 2023, the Bank of Thailand mandated facial biometric verification for transactions exceeding 50,000 baht, and 200,000 baht per day, and raised credit transfer limits on mobile devices. As per Group-IB’s research, GoldPickaxe likely reached Vietnam in February 2024 when a Vietnamese citizen performed a facial recognition scan, withdrawing over 40,000 USD.\nThe State Bank of Vietnam plans to mandate facial authentication as a security measure for all money transfers from April 2024, indicating the potential exploitation of GoldPickaxe in the country. The use of GoldPickaxe in Vietnam is expected to increase assessed Group—IB.\n“GoldFactory is a resourceful team, having many tricks up their sleeve: impersonation, accessibility keylogging, fake banking websites, fake bank alerts, fake call screens, identity and facial recognition data collection. Equipped with diverse tools, they have the flexibility to select and execute the most suitable one that fits the scenario,” researchers noted.\nThe report highlights the growing cybersecurity threat and the sophisticated techniques used by cybercriminals. They have refined GoldDigger malware, introduced new categories for facial recognition data harvesting, and developed a tool for communication between victims and cybercriminals. Group-IB researchers emphasize the need for proactive, multi-faceted cybersecurity measures, including user education.\nNew Rust-Based macOS Backdoor Steals Files, Linked to Ransomware Groups\nBitdefender researchers have discovered a new backdoor targeting macOS devices. The backdoor, dubbed, Trojan.MAC.RustDoor is written in Rust language and can steal specific files, archive them, and upload them to the C2 (command and control) server.\nAccording to the researchers, the backdoor has been active since November 2023. While Bitdefender could not attribute the campaign to a known threat actor, artefacts and indicators of compromise (IoCs) suggest a possible relationship with BlackBasta and ALPHV\/BlackCat ransomware operators.\nThe backdoor impersonates a Visual Studio update, distributed as FAT binaries with Mach-O files for Intel x86_64 and ARM architectures. Samples identified by Bitdefender were titled:\nThe first samples were found in November 2023 and the newest on 2nd February 2024. The Rust-based source code makes it harder for security researchers to analyze and detect its malicious code, potentially giving malware authors an advantage.\nThe backdoor has multiple variants, named Variant 1, Variant 2, and Variant Zero, with most samples sharing core functionalities. Variant 1 is a testing version, first seen on 22nd November 2023, and contains an embedded plist file. It is meant to ensure persistence using LaunchAgents but does not include a field for this method. \nThe second variant, found on 30th November 2023, is an upgraded version of the malware, containing a complex JSON configuration and an embedded Apple script for data exfiltration. The script is used to exfiltrate documents with specific extensions and sizes from Documents and Desktop folders, as well as user notes stored in SQLite format. \nVariant Zero, discovered on 2nd February 2024, is the least complex variant, lacking Apple script and embedded configuration, despite its backdoor functionality.\nAll samples contain the backdoor functionality, with supported commands such as ps, shell, cd, mkdir, rm, rmdir, sleep, upload, botkill, dialog, taskkill, and download. These commands allow the malware to gather and upload files and gather information about the machine. \nAdditionally, the information extracted with the sysctl command and the output of two other commands (pwd and hostname) are submitted to the Register endpoint of the C&C server to receive a Victim ID.\nAccording to Bitdefender’s blog post, communication with the C2 servers is performed using endpoints such as POST \/gateway\/register, POST \/gateway\/report, \/gateway\/task, and \/tasks\/upload_file. The C2 servers are currently answering with “detail”: “Not found.”\nTrojan.MAC.RustDoor is a malware family that employs multiple persistence mechanisms, including lock_in_cron, lock_in_launch, lock_in_dock, and lock_in_rc. These methods are common in recent malware families but not as popular. Lock_in_cron involves using cronjobs, while lock_in_launch uses LaunchAgents to execute the binary every time a user logs in.\nLock_in_rc is achieved by modifying the ~\/.zshrc file to execute the binary every time a new ZSH session is opened. Lock_in_dock is achieved by adding the binary to the Dock using the command defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add.\nThis is an ongoing research. Hackread.com will update readers when new details are shared regarding the likely threat actors behind this operation.\nBackdoor Discovered in XZ Utils: Patch Your Systems Now (CVE-2024-3094)\nA critical security vulnerability, designated CVE-2024-3094, was recently discovered in the widely used XZ Utils package. This vulnerability threatens Linux systems with backdoor attacks.\nFor your information, XZ Utils is a collection of open-source command-line tools for data compression and decompression. It includes the popular xz command and the liblzma library, which is used by other software, most notably OpenSSH – the program that enables secure remote access to Linux systems.\nThe vulnerability involved a malicious backdoor hidden within the source code of XZ Utils, specifically in the liblzma library. This backdoor code, if triggered, could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized remote access to a vulnerable system through SSH. The attacker wouldn’t even need valid credentials, potentially granting complete control over the system.\nThe potential impact of this vulnerability is severe. An attacker exploiting CVE-2024-3094 could steal sensitive data, install malware, disrupt critical operations, or even use the compromised system to launch further attacks.\nFortunately, the backdoor was discovered by the security community in late March 2024 before widespread distribution. This prevented a large-scale security breach. However, some Linux users remain vulnerable, especially those using unstable or rolling-release distributions.\nAccording to OpenSSH’s report, the specific versions of XZ Utils containing the backdoor were 5.6.0 and 5.6.1. These versions were only recently released and did not make it into the stable branches of most major Linux distributions. However, users who manually compiled these versions from source code or installed them from non-standard repositories could be at risk.\nCommenting on this, John Bambenek, President at Bambenek Consulting warned, “The original reports of this backdoor showed exploitation of this vulnerability via SSH which means it can be triggered even if the victim machine’s users don’t use XZ and its library. It seems this library tends to be installed by default on modern Linux distributions so organizations should immediately prioritize downgrading the package until a safe update is released, even if they don’t use the tools themselves.“\nThe most critical step to address this vulnerability is to update your system immediately. Most Linux distributions have released patch updates for XZ Utils. Here’s how to update depending on your distribution:\nThe discovery of CVE-2024-3094 emphasizes the importance of various security measures. Firstly, keeping software and systems updated with regular patches is crucial to mitigate potential risks. \nSecondly, maintaining a sharp review process for open-source projects aids in the early detection of vulnerabilities. Thirdly, promoting security awareness among users and employees through education about risks and best practices is essential for enhancing overall protection. Adhering to these practices enables us to reduce the impact of vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-3094 and safeguard the security of our systems.\nChinese Hackers Infiltrate Dutch Defense Networks with Coathanger RAT\nThe Dutch intelligence services have warned about a growing trend of threat actors targeting edge devices, such as VPNs, email servers, and firewalls, with the recent disclosure of zero-days in Ivanti VPNs providing threat actors an opportunity to infiltrate networks.\nThe warning comes after Dutch defence networks were infiltrated by Chinese state-backed spies using a new malware to steal sensitive information. The Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) identified a China-sponsored actor as the attacker.\n“MIVD & AIVD assess with high confidence that the malicious activity was conducted by a state-sponsored actor from the People’s Republic of China. This is part of a wider trend of Chinese political espionage against the Netherlands and its allies.”\nReportedly, the Chinese cyber espionage actors targeted the Dutch military by exploiting a FortiGate device flaw to remotely connect to networks. The initial intrusion began with the exploitation of CVE-2022-42475, a zero-day vulnerability that Fortinet warned was being exploited by advanced actors. After infiltration, the Chinese threat actors deployed a new “stealthy and persistent” RAT called Coathanger.\nThe RAT was installed on FortiGate devices using the high-impact vulnerability (CVE-2022-42475) in December 2022. The malware aimed to maintain network access, potentially using the RAT in combination with any FortiGate device vulnerability.\nThe actor conducted reconnaissance of the R&D network and exfiltrated the user accounts list from the Active Directory server. However, the intrusion’s impact was limited due to the targeted network’s segmentation from wider MOD networks. The Dutch military defenders foiled the cyber-espionage plot and its self-contained system did not cause any collateral damage.\nFurther proving revealed that the yet unpublished Coathanger malware has been specifically designed for FortiGate appliances. It is a stealthy and persistent RAT hiding through system calls and surviving reboots and firmware upgrades. This second-stage malware is named after a phrase used to encrypt disk configuration- ‘She took his coat and hung it up.’\nAfter infecting FortiGate devices, the malware connects to a C2 server over SSL providing a BusyBox reverse shell. Any published or unpublished vulnerabilities can be exploited for initial network access, with Coathanger serving as a backdoor afterwards.\nIt is worth noting that the Netherlands has publicly criticized Beijing for state-sponsored hacking for the first time. The country’s Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren emphasized the importance of publicly releasing a technical report on Chinese hackers’ methods, aiming to enhance international resilience against cyber espionage.\n“For the first time, the MIVD has chosen to make public a technical report on the working methods of Chinese hackers. It is important to attribute such espionage activities by China,” Ollongren said.\nMIVD notified Fortinet PSIRT of the malware’s existence. To mitigate these threats, organizations should regularly perform risk analysis, limit internet access, analyze logs for anomalous activity, install vendor security updates, and replace outdated hardware and software. This will help protect against potential attacks on public internet-connected devices.\nMispadu Stealer’s New Variant Targets Browser Data of Mexican Users\nIn a recent development reported by Unit 42 researchers, a new variant of the infamous Mispadu Stealer has emerged, targeting users primarily in Mexico with stealthy information-stealing techniques. The discovery shows the persistent evolution of this malware, showcasing its adaptability and the challenges it poses to cybersecurity efforts.\nInitially identified in 2019, Mispadu Stealer has been a persistent threat, known for its stealthy operations primarily targeting Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking victims. The latest variant, however, demonstrates a high level of sophistication, specifically targeting regions and URLs associated with Mexican citizens.\nThe discovery of this new variant came as part of Unit 42’s Managed Threat Hunting initiative, while researchers were investigating the Windows Defender SmartScreen CVE-2023-36025 vulnerability. \nThis vulnerability, categorized as a security feature bypass within the Windows SmartScreen function, allows attackers to circumvent warnings and execute malicious payloads. Exploiting this vulnerability, the Mispadu Stealer variant was found to employ a crafty technique involving the creation of internet shortcut files (.url) or hyperlinks pointing to malicious files, effectively bypassing SmartScreen’s warnings.\nOne of the key findings in this investigation is the malware’s use of a parameter referencing a network share, which, when embedded in a .url file, directs victims to a threat actor’s network share to retrieve and execute the malicious payload without triggering SmartScreen warnings. This technique, while not limited to Mispadu Stealer, showcases the malware’s ability to adapt and evolve its tactics.\nFurther analysis of the new variant reveals a sophisticated operation that selectively targets victims based on their geographic location and system configurations. By querying the bias between the local time zone and UTC and performing checks based on the victim’s location, the malware ensures its execution primarily within specific regions, such as the Americas and certain parts of Western Europe.\nOnce executed, the malware proceeds to interact with the victim’s browser history, extracting URLs and checking them against a targeted list. Notably, the malware employs encryption algorithms and techniques to evade detection, highlighting the evolving sophistication of its information-stealing capabilities.\nThe attribution of this new variant to previous Mispadu campaigns highlights the challenges in combating evolving cybersecurity threats. While similarities in tactics and infrastructure provide insights into the malware’s origins, the ever-changing nature of such threats demands a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity.\nAs Mispadu continues to evolve and target unsuspecting users, cybersecurity experts emphasize the importance of staying informed on the latest threat intelligence, deploying strong endpoint protection measures, and advocating a culture of cybersecurity awareness among employees and users. By adopting proactive measures and leveraging collective intelligence, organizations can better defend against emerging threats like the new variant of Mispadu Stealer.\nFBI Disrupts Chinese State-Backed Volt Typhoon’s KV Botnet\nIn a recent court-authorized operation conducted in December 2023, significant disruption was made to a botnet comprised of hundreds of U.S.-based small office\/home office (SOHO) routers. These routers had been hijacked by state-sponsored hackers affiliated with the People’s Republic of China (PRC), a group known in private sectors as “Volt Typhoon.”\nThe operation targeted routers infected with the “KV Botnet” malware, which the hackers used to conceal the origin of their hacking activities directed against U.S. and other foreign targets. \nIdentified by both Microsoft and U.S. authorities, Volt Typhoon, infiltrated a wide array of critical infrastructure organizations in the United States, including communications, manufacturing, utilities, transportation, construction, maritime, government, IT, and education.\nThe sophistication and dangers posed by the threat actors were also highlighted in a May 2023 advisory from the FBI, National Security Agency, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and foreign partners.\nThe botnet primarily comprised Cisco and NetGear routers that had reached “end of life” status, meaning they were no longer supported by security patches or updates from their manufacturers. The operation aimed to remove the KV Botnet malware from these routers and sever their connection to the botnet, thereby preventing further exploitation.\nIn a press release, FBI Director Christopher Wray condemned the actions of the Volt Typhoon, noting the potential real-world threat their activities posed to the safety of American citizens and critical infrastructure. He underscored the FBI’s determination to thwart such malicious activities and work with partners to protect against cyber threats.\nFor additional insights, we reached out to Toby Lewis, Global Head of Threat Analysis at Darktrace, a leading provider of global cyber security artificial intelligence. Toby cautioned that while the botnet may be a thing of the past, the group behind it still exists and could potentially resurface with a fresh botnet.\n“The actions by the US government have likely significantly disrupted Volt Typhoon’s infrastructure, but the attackers themselves remain free. Targeting infrastructure and dismantling attacker capabilities usually leads to a period of quiet from the actors where they rebuild and retool, which we’re probably going to see now,” said Toby.\n“The government’s ambitious approach to mimic the attacker’s own command network is a win in the short term, but there is no way to guarantee that this has a lasting impact on the threat landscape,” Toby explained. “Organizations need intelligent systems which can detect subtle, emerging, and novel threats and take targeted action without relying on knowledge of the attacker’s specific systems,” he warned.\nNevertheless, the FBI provided notice of the operation to owners or operators of infected SOHO routers and encouraged them to replace end-of-life routers to prevent future exploitation. The investigation into the Volt Typhoon’s activities continues, with efforts ongoing to mitigate further cyber threats posed by the group.\nIvanti VPN Flaws Exploited to Spread KrustyLoader Malware\nCybersecurity concerns are rising as hackers try to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in Ivanti VPN devices to deploy malware and cryptocurrency miners. The vulnerabilities, identified as CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 were discovered in Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS) and Ivanti Policy Secure Gateway appliances, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands remotely on targeted hosts to load a Rust-based malware named KrustyLoader.\n“Vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS), formerly known as Pulse Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure gateways. These vulnerabilities impact all supported versions – Version 9.x and 22.x,” Ivanti confirmed in a recent advisory.\nCVE-2023-46805 is an Authentication Bypass flaw with a CVSS score of 8.2. It allows a remote attacker to bypass control checks in the web component of Ivanti ICS 9.x, 22.x, and Ivanti Policy Secure.\nCVE-2024-21887, is a command injection vulnerability, with a CVSS score of 9.1. It is discovered in Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x, 22.x) and Ivanti Policy Secure web components, and allows an authenticated administrator to exploit Ivanti appliances by sending crafted requests and executing arbitrary commands.\nTargets include global small to large businesses, including Fortune 500 companies, government departments, telecommunications, defence contractors, technology firms, banking, finance, accounting institutions, consulting services, and aerospace entities.\nThe issues were first reported by Volexity, according to which these vulnerabilities have been exploited as zero-days as early as 3 December 2023. They identified a Chinese threat actor named UTA0178 (tracked by Mandiant as UNC5221) to be responsible for this exploitation. Volexity was alerted after discovering an attacker executing webshells on multiple internal and external-facing web servers.\nThe company launched an investigation and discovered over 2,100 compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPN devices using the GIFTEDVISITOR webshell in December 2023. A new scan in January 2024 revealed 368 more compromised devices.\nResearchers inspected a compromised Connect Secure VPN appliance and found that UTA0178 made modifications to the in-built Integrity Checker Tool, causing the tool to report no new or mismatched files.\nSynacktiv researcher Théo Letailleur conducted an extensive probe and discovered that threat actors are exploiting Ivanti zero-days to install an XMRig cryptocurrency miner and execute a Golang-based Sliver backdoor from a remote server.\nKrustyLoader served as a loader to download\/execute Sliver on compromised hosts. Since it is based on Rust language, it is challenging to fully comprehend the malware’s behaviour.\nBishop Fox’s Sliver is a post-exploitation toolkit designed for cybercriminals to maintain control over compromised systems. It gained popularity among cybercriminals in 2023 after law enforcement attempted to shut down ‘cracked’ versions of Cobalt Strike. \nThe backdoor offers extensive functionalities, including network spying, command execution, loading reflective DLLs, and spawning sessions. Synacktiv reports that all samples download Sliver from different URLs, and establish a connection with the C2 using HTTP\/HTTPS communication.\nIvanti’s advisory suggests that if CVE-2024-21887 and CVE-2023-46805 are used together, an attacker can send malicious requests to unpatched systems without authentication, allowing arbitrary command execution.\nIvanti and Mandiant are working to address over 2100 system compromises, and a patch was scheduled for January 30. However, no patch is currently available.\nMicrosoft Teams External Access Abuses to Spread DarkGate Malware\nCybersecurity experts from AT&T Cybersecurity have uncovered a concerning trend: Microsoft Teams, the widely used collaboration platform, being exploited as a vector for phishing scams and malware attacks.\nWhile traditional phishing via email remains a pervasive threat, the integration of External Access in Microsoft Teams has opened up a new frontier for malicious actors to exploit. For your information, External Access enables streamlined communication and collaboration with individuals outside your organization using Teams, Skype for Business, or Skype.\nIn a recent incident reported by AT&T Cybersecurity’s Managed Detection and Response (MDR) team, a client raised alarms after an external user, not affiliated with their organization, initiated unsolicited Microsoft Teams chats with internal members. Suspicions were raised, and upon investigation, it was confirmed that the chats were indeed phishing lures.\nThe sophistication of the attack was revealed in a blog post published on January 30, 2024, as the MDR team delved deeper into the incident. Analysis of the tactics and indicators of compromise (IOCs) employed by the attacker uncovered associations with DarkGate malware, a notorious threat in the large as well we small businesses. \nThe DarkGate malware first emerged on December 25th, 2017, initially functioning as a password stealer and cryptocurrency miner, primarily spreading through Torrent files. It was identified by enSilo researcher Adi Zeligson, who observed its targeting of Windows workstations.\nIn October 2023, DarkGate resurfaced, this time associated with threat actors based in Vietnam. Their latest campaign focused on infiltrating META accounts, particularly in India, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\nAs for the latest attack, the timely intervention of the MDR SOC team thwarted the attack before significant damage could occur, showcasing the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures.\nKey to the investigation was the identification of suspicious activities within the Teams environment. Over 1,000 Microsoft Teams events were flagged, indicating the scope of the phishing attempt. By leveraging Microsoft 365 tenant IDs and meticulously tracing chat interactions, the MDR SOC team successfully pinpointed compromised accounts and assets for remediation.\nFurther examination revealed that some users had unwittingly downloaded double-extension files, a common tactic used by attackers to conceal malicious executables. Armed with this information, the client swiftly took action, initiating password resets and isolating infected assets to contain the threat.\nAs organizations increasingly rely on collaboration platforms like Teams for remote work, they must remain alert against emerging threats. Recommendations from AT&T Cybersecurity include considering the disabling of External Access in Microsoft Teams, unless essential for business operations, and reinforcing user training to recognize and report phishing attempts across all communication channels.\nChina-Linked Blackwood APT Deploys Advanced NSPX30 Backdoor in Cyberespionage\nESET researchers have discovered a new China-aligned APT group, Blackwood, using advanced implants in cyberespionage attacks targeting individuals and companies in China, Japan, and the UK. \nThe researchers identified NSPX30, a sophisticated implant used by Blackwood, which uses adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) techniques to hijack update requests from legitimate software. \nESET traced NSPX30’s evolution back to Project Wood, a simple backdoor, with the oldest sample found in 2005. The implants’ evolution began on January 9th, 2005. The backdoor collects system and network information, records keystrokes, and takes screenshots, as indicated by PE (Portable Executable) header timestamps in the loader and backdoor components\nBlackwood backdoor has been operating since 2018, and in 2020, malicious activity on a targeted system in China increased. The NSPX30 implant, a multistage implant, was detected on a few systems, with victims including:\n“Unidentified individuals in China and Japan, a Chinese-speaking individual connected to a high-profile UK public research university, a large Chinese manufacturing company, and China-based offices of a Japanese corporation,” researchers stated in a blog post.\nNSPX30 is a modular implant with plugins that can steal sensitive data, monitor user activity, and disrupt system operations, potentially causing damage. Utilizing the NSPX30 implant, a sophisticated spying tool, attackers employ a strategy to re-compromise systems in the event of lost access. \nESET Research has identified a concerning pattern where legitimate software, such as Tencent QQ, Sogou Pinyin, and WPS Office, downloads updates from unencrypted HTTP servers. This vulnerability enables attackers to establish communication channels, gather data, and capture screenshots.\nTo further hide their activities, attackers leverage interception techniques to anonymize their infrastructure. The malicious traffic generated by NSPX30 is then seamlessly forwarded to the attackers’ infrastructure through an undisclosed mechanism.\nThe discovery of NSPX30 active since 2005, highlights how cybersecurity threats have evolved over the years. The discovery also emphasizes the need for strong cybersecurity practices, including keeping software updated, being cautious about suspicious attachments, and investing in security solutions with advanced malware detection capabilities, to better defend against this persistent threat.\nThe Fake Fix: New Chae$ 4.1 Malware Hides in Driver Downloads\nMorphisec Threat Labs has documented its findings on Chae$ 4.1, an update to the Chae malware Infostealer series, as part of its investigation of emerging cyber threats. The report explores the new Chae$ variant, highlighting its mechanics, implications, and safeguarding measures.\nBack in September 2023, Morphisec shared its analysis on a new variant of Chae$ malware, dubbed Chae$4 with Hackread.com. The malware targeted login credentials, financial data, and other sensitive information of e-commerce customers particularly in Brazil. \nChae$4 was quickly evolving, and in its latest research blog, Morphisec provided details on the updates in Chae$ 4.1, which includes an improved Chronod module and surprisingly, a direct message to the Morphisec team within the source code. Version 4.1 is a significant improvement over previous brute force and basic obfuscation methods.\nThe infection chain begins with an email in the Portuguese language, claiming to be an urgent request from a lawyer concerning a legal case. The victim is then redirected to a deceptive website, (totalavprotectionshop\/abrirProcesso.php?email=), where they are prompted to download a ZIP file. This website also functions as a deceptive website for TotalAV, directly delivering the MSI installer without the intermediary step of a ZIP file.\nAnother website, (webcamcheckonline), allegedly scans the machine for risks and updates the driver after scanning. After the victim clicks the BLOCK button, JavaScript gets executed in the background, mimicking a legitimate system scan, which presents a hardcoded list of files, creating the illusion of a comprehensive computer analysis of the device.\nOnce the scanning is complete, the attacker sends a message stating “Security Risk Detected” and prompts the victim to download an updated driver to eliminate the risk. The unsuspecting victim clicks on the button, which triggers a script named download.js to run the malicious installer.\nWith the installer activated, Chae$ 4.1 also gets triggered, and from this point, the attack chain follows a similar path as Morphisec discovered in previous analyses except for some advancements in the Chae$ framework, such as modifications in the Chronod module. After successful activation, exfiltrated data is delivered to the threat actor’s C2 and the Chae$ team panel login page.\nThe Chronod module intercepts user activity to steal information like login credentials and banking information. It spans over 2,000 lines of code and has been adjusted to steal credentials from specific services like WhatsApp, AWS, and WordPress. In version 4.1, the Chae$ team rewrote the module to be more generic and modular, dividing the logic into several classes instead of one class responsible for all functionality.\nChae$ 4.1 also employs advanced code polymorphism to bypass antivirus detection, and detect sandbox environments, raising concerns about its potential impact on users. \nTo stay safe, regularly update your operating system and software, use a layered security solution with advanced malware detection, be cautious when clicking on suspicious links or opening attachments, and regularly back up critical data. Staying informed and adopting robust security practices can help protect against cyberattacks.\nFBI: Androxgh0st Malware Building Mega-Botnet for Credential Theft\nThe FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have issued a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) revealing that Androxgh0st malware operators are trying to create a powerful botnet for victim identification and exploitation in target networks.\nIt is worth noting that, the AndroxGh0st malware was initially reported in December 2022. Thereupon, cybercriminals have continued presenting malware variants within the same family. Notably, one such instance is the Legion malware, known for its capabilities in credential harvesting and SMS hijacking.\nAs per the advisory, the malware targets .env files containing sensitive information like cloud credentials for high-profile applications, including Amazon Web Services Inc. Microsoft Office 365, SendGrid, and Twilio using Python-scripted techniques.\nAndroxgh0st also supports functions to abuse the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, such as scanning\/exploiting credentials. It exploits vulnerabilities in web applications and servers, particularly those using the Laravel framework and PHPUnit, and certain versions of the Apache HTTP Server.\nThe threat actors have been using critical vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2017-9841, which allows remote PHP code execution via PHPUnit, and CVE-2021-41773, which affects Apache web servers running versions 2.4.49 or 2.4.50.\nAndroxgh0st malware TTPs involve scripts, scanning, and searching for websites with specific vulnerabilities. Threat actors exploit CVE-2017-9841 to run PHP code on fallible websites via PHPUnit remotely. \nFurthermore, websites with exposed \/vendor folders are subject to malicious HTTP POST requests to the \/vendor\/phpunit\/phpunit\/src\/Util\/PHP\/eval-stdin.php uniform resource identifier. Threat actors use Androxgh0st to download malicious files and set up fake pages for backdoor access, allowing them to download additional malicious files and access databases.\nAndroxgh0st malware creates a botnet to scan and identify websites using the Laravel web application framework, determining if the domain’s root-level.env file is exposed. If exposed, they issue a GET request to the \/.env URI or a POST request with a POST variable containing data sent to the web server. This method is used for websites in debug mode, where non-production websites are exposed to the internet. \nA successful response allows threat actors to look for usernames, passwords, and credentials for services like email and AWS accounts. The malware can access the Laravel application key on a website, enabling attackers to encrypt PHP code and pass it as a value in the cross-site forgery request (XSRF) token cookie, allowing remote code execution and remote file upload via CVE-2018-15133 vulnerability.\nRegarding CVE-2021-41773, Androxgh0st operators scan vulnerable web servers running Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.49 or 2.4.50, identifying uniform resource locators for files outside the root directory through path traversal attacks. They can obtain service credentials, access sensitive data, and conduct malicious operations. They have been observed creating new users and policies and conducting additional scanning activity.\nTo combat malicious cyber activity, prioritize patching exploited vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems, ensure only necessary servers and services are exposed to the internet, and review platforms\/services with credentials listed in .env files for unauthorized access or use.\nFor insights into the latest security advisory, we reached out to John A. Smith, CEO of Conversant Group. “The CISA advisory provides Indicators of Compromise, which are very helpful. We also advise that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure—because AndroxGh0st is exploiting exposed .env files and unpatched vulnerabilities, it is well-advised to always inspect and monitor cloud environments regularly for any exposures and, have a very aggressive policy for out-of-band patching.”\nKaspersky’s iShutdown Tool Detects Pegasus Spyware on iOS Devices\nKaspersky’s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) has introduced a new tool that lets users detect Pegasus, a popular iOS spyware known for targeting journalists and activists. This lightweight method called iShutdown will identify signs of spyware on Apple iOS devices, including three prominent spyware families Pegasus, QuaDream’s Reign, and Intellexa’s Predator.\nThe iShutdown tool is now available to the public, seven months after Kaspersky Labs initially reported the hacking of its employees’ iPhones, referred to as Operation Triangulation. In December 2023, the company released an update disclosing that hackers likely exploited an obscure hardware feature during spyware attacks against iPhone users.\nThe method was tested on a set of Pegasus-compromised iPhones. However, it must be noted that this method\/tool is different from the iShutdown iOS application that allows Mac devices to shut down\/sleep\/restart\/log out.\nAccording to the cybersecurity firm, traces of Pegasus-related processes were discovered in a text-based system log file called “Shutdown.log” on iPhones compromised with the spyware. \nThe log file is stored within the sysdiagnose archive of iOS devices. It records every reboot event with its environmental characteristics and is a generally overlooked forensic artefact. It can have entries dating back several years, providing valuable information. When a user initiates a reboot, the operating system terminates running processes, flushing memory buffers, and waiting for a normal reboot.\nIts analysis revealed “sticky” processes that hinder reboots. Pegasus-related processes were found in over four reboot delay notices. These anomalies during reboot procedures allowed the tool to flag potential infections with high accuracy. Further analysis revealed a similar filesystem path used by all three spyware families, “\/private\/var\/db\/” for Pegasus and Reign, and “\/private\/var\/tmp\/” for Predator, as an indicator of compromise.\nKaspersky GReAT’s lead security researcher, Maher Yamout, has confirmed the log’s consistency with other Pegasus infections, making it a reliable forensic artefact for infection analysis. The tool offers enhanced protection to a broader user base.\n“Compared to more time-consuming acquisition methods such as forensic device imaging or a full iOS backup, Shutdown.log file recovery is pretty simple,” explained Yamout.\nKaspersky has developed a Python3 utility on GitHub for macOS, Windows, and Linux users to detect spyware. The tool extracts, analyzes, and parses Shutdown.log artifacts. It simplifies detection and raises awareness, empowering users to take control of their digital security.\nHowever, Kaspersky suggests users adopt a holistic approach towards data and device security. The company recommends users perform daily reboots, use lockdown mode, disable iMessage and FaceTime, timely iOS updates, and regular check backups.\nThe announcement comes after SentinelOne’s report revealing that information stealers targeting macOS like KeySteal, Atomic, and JaskaGo are quickly adapting to circumvent Apple’s built-in antivirus technology called XProtect.\nDutch Man Deployed Stuxnet via Water Pump to Disable Iran’s Nukes\nA two-year-long investigation by the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant has uncovered a startling operation where a Dutch engineer was recruited by the Netherlands’ intelligence agency, the AIVD, to deploy malware at an Iranian nuclear facility using a seemingly harmless water pump.\nThe then 36-year-old Dutch civil engineer, Erik van Sabben, played a ‘crucial role’ in a 2007 mission backed by the US and Israel to sabotage an Iranian nuclear complex, releasing a highly advanced software virus called Stuxnet, bringing the Iranian nuclear program to a halt. \nThe malware was planted on a water pump installed in the Natanz-based Iranian nuclear complex after Van Sabben infiltrated it. His family claims he panicked before the attack. He died in a motorbike crash in Dubai two years after this incident.\nReportedly, Van Sabben worked at Dubai-based heavy transport firm, TTS International, where he could easily transport Western equipment to Iran. He was willing to take risks as he and his employer had connections in Iran. \nHe used his position as a cover to infiltrate the facility and deliver the Stuxnet payload. The cover-and-stricken operation, involving the American CIA and Israeli Mossad, destroyed nearly a thousand ultracentrifuges for uranium enrichment, causing Iran’s nuclear weapons program to be delayed for a few years.\nVan Sabben was recruited in 2005 for this job because he seemed the ideal candidate as he had a sound technical background, did business in Iran, and was married to an Iranian woman, Volkskrant journalist Huib Modderkolk wrote in their detailed investigative report. \nIn 2012, The New York Times reported that former US Presidents George Bush Jr. and Barack Obama had personally granted permission to deploy Stuxnet in Iran, aiming to break centrifuges without Iran’s knowledge of the source of the sabotage. However, the Dutch agency did not inform its then government led by the CDA’s Jan Pieter Balkenende and the parliamentary committee about this mission.\nDe Volkskrant’s investigation reveals that Stuxnet cost between $1 and $2 billion. However, cybersecurity experts like WithSecure’s chief research officer Mikko Hypponen, have expressed doubts about the actual cost. Raiu also noted that the Stuxnet version Van Sabben installed back then could be Stuxnet 0.5, which wasn’t as impactful as its subsequent variants.\nIn 2019, the paper claimed that while the Netherlands played a significant role in the Stuxnet sabotage campaign, initially it was believed that the virus was installed by an Iranian engineer. MPs have called for an investigation into the claims, and the operation is also the subject of an NPO 2 documentary series.\nTheMoon Malware Returns: 6,000 Asus Routers Hacked in 72 Hours\nA multi-year campaign targeting vulnerable home and small business routers has come to light thanks to a recent report by Black Lotus Labs, a security research team at Lumen Technologies. The campaign leverages an updated version of a well-known malware strain called “TheMoon.”\nTheMoon malware first emerged in 2014 and has a history of exploiting weaknesses in routers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This latest campaign, however, appears to be particularly widespread, infecting devices across 88 countries.\nAccording to the Black Lotus Labs report, the attackers primarily focused on end-of-life (EoL) routers, meaning devices no longer receive security updates from the manufacturer. ASUS routers were the most targeted, with over 6,000 infected in just 72 hours in early March 2024.\nThe attackers’ goal appears to be the creation of a large network of compromised devices. By infecting routers and IoT devices, they can add them to a service known as “Faceless.” Faceless operates as a proxy service, allowing malicious actors to anonymize their online activities. This anonymization can make it difficult to track the source of cyberattacks and other criminal operations.\nJason Soroko, Senior Vice President of Product at Sectigo told Hackread.com that, “Routers and other networking equipment that use passwords have been easy victims to pray and spray attacks for years.“ \n“Unfortunately, stronger forms of authentication are not common. What’s new here is the usage of proxy networks for C2 traffic obfuscation. It shows that de-anonymizing Tor and VPN traffic is not only happening but has been successfully used against attackers,“ Jason added. \nTo protect your devices from the latest variant of TheMoon malware or similar attacks; always follow these steps:\nThere are many more technical details and aspects addressed in the Black Lotus Labs blog post.\nYouTube Channels Hacked to Spread Lumma Stealer via Cracked Software\nThe cybersecurity researchers at Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs have uncovered a new wave of cyber threats as malicious threat actors leverage YouTube channels to spread the notorious Lumma Stealer through cracked software.\nThe malware campaigns investigated by researchers involve YouTube videos disguising content related to cracked applications, leading users to installation guides with hidden malicious URLs. \nWhat sets this apart is the attackers’ evasion technique, utilizing open-source platforms like GitHub and MediaFire, a file-sharing and cloud storage service, to avoid traditional web filter blacklists.\nThe specially crafted installation ZIP files act as effective baits, exploiting users’ intentions to install applications and prompting them to click on the malicious files without suspicion. The attackers employ a private .NET loader equipped with environment checks, anti-virtual machine measures, and anti-debugging functions.\nLumma Stealer, a well-known threat targeting sensitive information such as user credentials, system details, browser data, and extensions, has been actively promoted on the dark web and Telegram channels since 2022. The malware’s global presence is evident, with a peak observed in December.\nIn their blog post research shared with Hackread.com ahead of publication on Tuesday, FortiGuard Labs detailed the complex stages of the attack, digging deeper into the tactics employed by the threat group.\nThe modus operandi of the malware campaign involves attackers compromising a YouTuber’s account and uploading videos that appear as legitimate cracked software sharing.\nIn the next step, unsuspecting users are lured to download a ZIP file from file-sharing sites, which carries malicious content for the next stages of the attack. Regular updates to these files suggest that attackers are continuously revising their methods to spread malware effectively.\nIt is worth noting that the also campaign involves the use of a private .NET loader meaning, a kind of hidden tool which creates a special set of instructions to make sure it runs code without getting detected. This script, in turn, connects to GitHub repositories and downloads encrypted binary data from servers chosen based on system date evaluation.\nFurther, the DLL file, responsible for decoding Lumma Stealer’s payload, engages in extensive environment checks to evade analysis. This includes anti-VM and anti-debugging measures, as well as scrutiny for virtualization platforms and sandbox environments – Simply put: Lumma Stealer comes with capabilities which let it evade detection from anti-malware solutions.\nIn the new campaign, once Lumma Stealer infects the device, it proceeds to seek the victim’s browser data. It steals various types of information, such as login credentials, personal details, financial information, and cryptocurrency funds by accessing crypto wallets. Additionally, it targets other data, including browser extensions.\nYouTube, renowned as a great entertainment platform, has unfortunately also become a lucrative haven for cybercriminals. Over the years, the Google-owned site has witnessed a surge in major malware infections and crypto-related scams.\nIn October 2023, researchers reported a new threat known as Stream-Jacking, a tactic aimed at spreading Redline malware during live streams to steal cryptocurrency funds. The severity of the situation becomes apparent when considering that, in 2020, Google took action by deleting two million channels and 51 million videos due to the escalating prevalence of malware and cryptocurrency-related scams.\nNevertheless, as threat actors continue to equip Lumma Stealer with new malicious capabilities, users are urged to be on the lookout, particularly when dealing with applications from unclear sources, ensuring the use of legitimate applications and software from reputable and secure origins.\nAsyncRAT Infiltrates Key US Infrastructure Through GIFs and SVGs\nCybersecurity researchers at AT&T Alien Labs have discovered a campaign delivering the old and notorious AsyncRAT, a remote access trojan, to targeted systems over 11 months. The open-sourced RAT, released in 2019, has been used in multiple campaigns by various threat actors, including the APT Earth Berberoka (or GamblingPuppet) due to its keylogging, exfiltration techniques, and initial access staging.\nIn early September 2023, AT&T Alien Labs recorded a surge in phishing emails targeting specific individuals in specific companies, containing GIF attachments and SVG files, which facilitate the downloading\/execution of “highly obfuscated” JavaScript files, PowerShell scripts, and an AsyncRAT client.\nAT&T Alien Labs’ cybersecurity researcher Fernando Martinez wrote in the company’s blog post that users on X (formerly Twitter), including reecDeep and Igal Lytzki, reported this peculiarity in the code, prompting the researchers to continue to look for more AsyncRAT samples going as far back as February 2023.\nResearchers discovered that the campaign operators, with a focus on firms managing crucial US infrastructure, meticulously selected their targets. To avoid detection, they implemented obfuscation and anti-sandboxing techniques. The strategy involved random generation of variable names and values to enhance detection evasion. Additionally, they adopted a weekly recycling approach for DGA domains and employed redirection decoys to further thwart analysis efforts.\nThe loader’s modus operandi is spread over multiple stages with strong obfuscation techniques employed to deliver JavaScript files to targeted victims. The payload is delivered through malicious phishing webpages, containing long strings with randomly positioned words. \nA similar sample delivering AsyncRAT in March 2023 (reported by Ankit Anubhav) was hidden between Sanskrit characters. However, it employed different TTPs to deliver the final payload indicating that it was part of another campaign.\nThe code is constantly changing, obfuscated, and randomized, making it hard to detect. Domains like sduyvzeptop and orivzijetop share common characteristics like a Top Level Domain, 8 random alphanumeric characters, a registrar organization, and a country code, raising suspicion.\nThe Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) creates a seed based on the day of the year and makes modifications to ensure a new domain is created every seven days, with Sunday being the purposeful generation. The seed is then used to select 15 letters from ‘a’ to ‘n’, with variables (2024 and 6542) changing in scripts for different domain patterns.\nAT&T Labs discovered that an organization, Ivan Govno, has registered numerous domains with the Nicenic registrar, some with TLD top and matching attributes. The domains are hosted on BitLaunch (with identifier 399629), known for allowing payments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin, which attracts cybercriminals. \nBitLaunch is the cheapest option, but it offers users the option to pay in crypto and get hosted in a more reliable ASN. The DGA domains are hosted on DigitalOcean.\nIt is worth noting that this campaign is active, with ongoing domain registration and an OTX pulse providing more information. Nevertheless, AsyncRAT is a threat to individuals and organizations and makes it necessary to implement advanced security solutions and increased vigilance against emerging malware strains.\nNew Xamalicious Backdoor Infects 25 Android Apps, Affects 327K Devices\nMcAfee’s Mobile Research Team has uncovered a widespread Android backdoor threat, dubbed Xamalicious, showing sophisticated tactics to compromise user devices. The malware has exploited the Xamarin framework, employing its capabilities to hide malicious code within the APK file build process, enabling it to operate undetected.\nThis threat aims to gain accessibility privileges through social engineering, communicating with a command-and-control server to download a second-stage payload injected at runtime. \nOnce installed, the malware takes full control of the device, enabling various fraudulent actions such as clicking on ads, installing apps, and other financially motivated activities without user consent.\nWhat sets Xamalicious backdoor apart is its direct connection to the notorious ad-fraud app, “Cash Magnet.” This link exposes a financially motivated agenda behind the attacks, as Cash Magnet engages in automated ad clicks, app installations, and other actions to generate fraudulent revenue.\nAccording to the McAfee Mobile Research Team’s blog post, approximately 25 malicious apps carrying Xamalicious backdoor have been identified, some of which infiltrated Google Play since mid-2020. Despite Google’s proactive removal of these apps, the threat persists through third-party markets, compromising over 327,000 devices.\nThe impact of this threat is far-reaching, affecting users across continents. The most significant activities have been observed in the USA, Brazil, Argentina, the UK, Spain, and Germany.\nSome of the affected apps that McAfee is urging users to delete are:\nOnce installed, the second-stage payload of the Xamalicious backdoor grants the malware full control over the device. This capability allows the malware to self-update the main APK and execute various activities, from acting as spyware to potentially operating as a banking trojan, all without requiring user interaction.\nThe modus operandi of the Xamalicious backdoor involves tricking users into granting accessibility service permissions. Exploiting vulnerabilities and prompting users to activate these services despite OS warnings manually, the malware gains a foothold on the device.\nXamalicious backdoor goes beyond typical malware by collecting extensive device information and communicating with a command-and-control server. The communication is safeguarded through the use of JSON Web Encryption (JWE) tokens. The malware’s DLL contains hardcoded RSA key values, opening the door for potential decryption during analysis.\nIf you are using Android devices, it is crucial to protect them from the Xamalicious malware and other emerging Android threats. Users are strongly advised to exercise caution when granting accessibility service permissions, particularly when an app does not have a legitimate need.\nInstalling reputable security software, such as McAfee Mobile Security, is recommended to mitigate the risks associated with malware infections. Regular updates are crucial to ensure ongoing protection against evolving threats in the mobile landscape. Stay informed, stay protected.\nUAC-0099 Hackers Using Old WinRAR Flaw in New Cyberattack on Ukraine\nCybersecurity researchers at Deep Instinct Lab have revealed a new series of cyberattacks carried out by ‘UAC-0099,’ specifically targeting Ukrainians. These attacks employ common tactics such as using fabricated court summons to entice targets into executing malicious files.\nThe group’s activities were initially revealed in May 2023 through the Ukrainian CERT advisory ‘#6710,’ and Deep Instinct has now provided exclusive insights into their latest attack.\nAccording to a blog post from the company, on December 21st, 2023, ‘UAC-0099’ utilized an email scam to impersonate the Lviv city court via the ukr.net email service. The target was a Ukrainian employee working remotely for a company outside Ukraine. The deceptive email contained an executable file created by WinRAR, named docx.lnk. \nAlthough appearing as a regular document, it was an LNK shortcut designed to execute PowerShell with malicious content, decoding two base64 blobs and writing the output into VBS and DOCX files.\nThe VBS malware, identified as ‘LonePage’ by CERT-UA, establishes a concealed PowerShell process that communicates with a predefined C2 URL to retrieve a text file. The script verifies the presence of the string ‘get-content’ in the text file, subsequently executing the code from the server and saving it as an array of bytes.\nThe LonePage VBS (VBS) proves to be a potent tool, enabling cybercriminals to infiltrate computers and execute malicious code. Employing a deceptive tactic, it utilizes a DOCX decoy document, tricking victims into believing they are opening a legitimate file. Employing a method akin to the LNK attack vector, the HTA technique involves an HTML file incorporating a VBScript that executes PowerShell with a recurring four-minute task cadence.\nIn both incidents, the pro-Russian gang exploited a recognized WinRAR vulnerability, designated as CVE-2023-38831 in August 2023, and identified by Group-IB. This vulnerability arises from the way WinRAR processes ZIP files, requiring user interaction with a specially crafted ZIP archive for exploitation.\nThe attacker crafts a seemingly harmless archive by appending a space after the file extension. This archive contains a folder with an identical name and an extra file bearing a “.cmd” extension. \nWhen a user double-clicks on the innocuous file, the associated “cmd” file is executed instead. This vulnerability heightens the risk of widespread infections, as even security-aware victims may inadvertently run malicious code while opening what appears to be a harmless file.\nResearchers have found this gang’s tactics simple yet effective. They rely on PowerShell and create a scheduled task to execute a VBS file. Monitoring\/restricting these components can reduce the risk of “UAC-0099” attacks and help identify them quickly in case of compromise.\nThis isn’t the first time Russian hackers have exploited known vulnerabilities. In early December, Hackread.com reported how the Russian GRU’s affiliated Forest Blizzard exploited an Outlook vulnerability allowing attackers to steal Net-NTLMv2 hashes and access user accounts.\nOn December 15, 2023, reports surfaced that Russian hackers breached a major US biomedical company in a TeamCity-linked attack. Despite the vulnerability, which scored 9.8 on the CVSS scale, being patched in September 2023, unpatched systems remain susceptible to ongoing cyberattacks.\nIran’s Peach Sandstorm Deploy FalseFont Backdoor in Defense Sector\nCybersecurity researchers at Microsoft Threat Intelligence Unit have uncovered the latest activities of the Iranian nation-state actor Peach Sandstorm, also known as HOLMIUM. The group has been making efforts to deploy a newly developed backdoor called FalseFont, specifically targeting individuals within the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). \nThis disclosure follows Microsoft’s earlier findings, outlined in a September 2023 blog post, where Peach Sandstorm was identified as targeting sectors such as satellites and pharmaceuticals on a global scale.\nMicrosoft’s investigative team believes that Peach Sandstorm is actively pursuing intelligence gathering for the Iranian government, aligning their actions with state interests.\nAccording to Microsoft’s tweets shared today, FalseFont stands out as a custom backdoor equipped with a diverse set of functionalities. These capabilities enable operators to gain remote access to compromised systems, execute additional files, and transmit information to its Command and Control (C2) servers. The first instances of FalseFont in action were detected against targets in early November 2023.\nThe development and deployment of FalseFont showcase a consistent evolution in Peach Sandstorm’s tactics, a trend observed by Microsoft over the past year. This suggests a continuous effort by Peach Sandstorm to enhance their tradecraft.\nIt’s worth noting that Microsoft Defender Antivirus already detects FalseFont as Backdoor:MSIL\/FalseFont.A!dha. Although Microsoft is monitoring Peach Sandstorm’s activities, unsuspecting users should be on the lookout for phishing and social engineering attacks that may be employed by Peach Sandstorm to spread the FalseFont backdoor.\nHere are some key points to follow for protection against phishing and social engineering attacks that may deliver the FalseFont backdoor to your device:\nGuarding Against Social Engineering Attacks Delivering FalseFont:\n8220 Gang Targets Telecom and Healthcare in Global Cryptojacking Attack\nImperva Threat Research has discovered undocumented activity from a hacker group known as the 8220 gang. This group is known for mass malware deployment using an ever-evolving arsenal of TTPs. The 8220 gang mainly targets Windows and Linux web servers with cryptojacking malware.\nThe 8220 gang, believed to be of Chinese origins, was first identified in 2017 by Cisco Talos when it targeted Drupal, Hadoop YARN, and Apache Struts2 applications for propagating cryptojacking malware. the group exploited Confluence and Log4j vulnerabilities, and recently, Trend Micro found them leveraging Oracle WebLogic vulnerability (CVE-2017-3506) to infect systems.\nAccording to Imperva’s blog post, the 8220 gang is also exploiting CVE-2020-14883, a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic Server, to spread malware. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute code using a gadget chain. It is often chained with CVE-2020-14882 (authentication bypass vulnerability) or leaked\/weak\/stolen credentials. The gang uses two gadget chains; one loads an XML file, and the other executes commands on the OS.\nDriven by financial motives, this gang uses simple exploits to target vulnerabilities and exploit easy targets. Despite their unsophisticated nature, they constantly evolve their tactics to evade detection. Attributing attacks to this group is straightforward due to their use of traceable IoCs and TTPs, frequently reusing the same IP addresses, web servers, payloads, and attack tools.\nThe 8220 gang uses various methods to target Linux hosts, including cURL, wget, lwp-download, python urllib, and a custom bash function. They also use a PowerShell WebClient command on Windows to execute a downloaded script. \nIn another variation, they use a gadget chain to run Java code without an externally hosted XML file. The injected Java code evaluates whether the OS is Windows or Linux and executes the appropriate command strings. The downloaded files are executed, infecting the exploited hosts with known AgentTesla, rhajk, and nasqa malware variants.\nAccording to Imperva researchers, the 8220 gang appears to be an opportunistic group because of its target selection, which includes healthcare, telecommunications, and financial services. \nIt mainly targets organizations in the United States, South Africa, Spain, Columbia, and Mexico. Moreover, the gang prefers using custom tools written in Python in their attack campaigns, and the attacking IPs are associated with known hosting companies.\nImperva Cloud WAF and on-prem WAF have identified and mitigated web vulnerabilities used by the 8220 gang for malicious activities. These vulnerabilities include CVE-2017-3506, CVE-2019-2725, CVE-2020-14883, CVE-2021-26084, CVE-2021-44228, Apache Log4j JNDI, and CVE-2022-26134.\nImperva is urging organizations to maintain security. Enterprises should patch their applications and implement multiple security measures to protect against falling victim to such groups.\nNew JaskaGO Malware Targets Mac and Windows for Crypto, Browser Data\nCybersecurity researchers at AT&T Alien Labs have discovered a sophisticated malware strain called JaskaGO, crafted in the Go (Golang) programming language and equipped with the ability to maintain persistence in infected systems. It can exfiltrate valuable information, including browser credentials and cryptocurrency wallet details.\nJaskaGO was detected in July 2023, targeting Mac users. Since then, the threat has evolved its capabilities and developed in both macOS and Windows versions, with a low detection rate, as evidenced by recent anti-virus engine samples.\nAccording to AT&T Alien Labs’ report, JaskaGO is a deceptive tool that presents a fake error message claiming a missing file to mislead users into believing the malicious code failed to run. \nFurther, it uses file names resembling well-known applications, such as “Capcut_Installer_Intel_M1.dmg” and “Anyconnect.exe,” suggesting a common strategy of malware deployment under the guise of legitimate software in pirated application web pages.\nThe malware first scans the system to determine if it is operating within a virtual machine (VM), obtaining general machine information, such as the number of processors, system up-time, available system memory, and MAC addresses. The presence of MAC addresses associated with well-known VM software, such as VMware or VirtualBox, is a key indicator.\nIf not detected, it starts collecting information and continuously queries its C2 server, awaiting instructions for various commands. These commands include creating persistence, stealer functionalities, pinging the command and control, executing shell commands, alert messages, retrieving the running process list, executing files on disk or in memory, writing to the clipboard, performing random tasks, downloading and executing additional payloads, initiating the process to exit (self), and initiating the process to exit and delete itself.\nJaskaGO is equipped with extensive data exfiltration capabilities, and stores acquired data in a specially created folder, zipping and sending it to the attacker. It can be configured to target additional browsers, collecting browser information such as credentials, history, cookies, password encryption keys, profile files, and login information.\nPersistence mechanisms are established through two methods: Service Creation in Windows and Execution as Root in macOS. In Windows, the malware creates a Windows Terminal profile by generating the file: UserName\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft. WindowsTerminal_*\\LocalState\\settings.json.” \nOn macOS, the malware employs a multi-step process to establish persistence within the system: Execution as Root, Disabling Gatekeeper, and Duplicating itself. To ensure persistence, the malware creates either LaunchDaemon or LaunchAgent based on successful root access to get automatically launched during system startup and further embed itself into the macOS environment.\nJaskaGO is still being investigated; but serves as a warning to Mac users who may have felt unaffected by cyber threats, emphasizing the importance of constant vigilance regardless of the chosen operating system.\nGlobal malspam targets hotels, spreading Redline and Vidar stealers\nCybersecurity researchers at Sophos X-Ops have issued a warning to the hospitality industry about a sophisticated malspam campaign targeting hotels worldwide. The campaign leverages social engineering tactics to lure hotel representatives into opening password-protected archives containing malware designed to steal sensitive data.\nA malspam attack is a cybersecurity threat where malicious actors send emails containing malware to infect your device and steal your data or disrupt your system. Imagine a spam email filled with not just junk, but hidden traps waiting to ensnare you. That’s essentially what a malspam attack is.\nAccording to researchers, attackers are targeting hotels worldwide with email complaints about service problems (e.g. allege violent attacks, bigoted behaviour, and theft of items) or requests for information (e.g. asking for accommodation for someone with allergies, business support, or accessibility for disabled or elderly guests) to create an aura of legitimacy before sending links to malicious payloads.\nThe malspam campaign was reported just days after FortiGuard Labs researchers identified a similar campaign targeting unsuspecting users with a fake hotel reservation\/booking scam. In this campaign, scammers compromised devices using the MrAnon Stealer.\nThese emails contain links to password-protected archives hosted on public cloud storage platforms like Google Drive. The password, often simple (e.g., “123456”), grants access to the malware, primarily of the Redline Stealer or Vidar Stealer families. It utilizes obfuscation techniques like password protection and jump commands to evade detection. Additionally, large file sizes (larger than executables) often containing zeroes as spacefill are used to prevent analysis.\nSophos researchers identified that the attackers are using the same methodology that they discovered in April 2023. The emails typically span a wide range of subjects that can be broadly categorized into complaints about serious issues faced during a recent stay at the hotel and requests for information for future bookings. \nEither way, the attackers send links to malware payloads wrapped in password-protected archive files, posing a threat to hotel representatives. In every case, the threat actor provided documentation as proof of their complaints, which contained malware. These messages are engineered to play on emotions. For instance, in one of the messages, the sender asks for help locating a camera with photos of a deceased relative. \nIn another sample, the threat actor claims to have already booked rooms through the website but needs accommodation for a family member with a disability with a link to a ZIP file containing medical records. The threat actor adds that the link may only be compatible with Windows computers.\nMost samples have a code-validation certificate, with some being new or fake. Endpoint protection tools may exclude valid certificates from scanning, or only check for the presence of a certificate. The malware connects to a Telegram encrypted messaging service URL. \nThe bot then downloads a payload from the URL and uses HTTP POST requests to submit telemetry about the infected machine. The malware does not establish persistence on the host machine, only runs once, extracts and exfiltrates data, and quits. The bot profiles the machine and sends information about it to the bot controller.\nSophos X-Ops has retrieved over 50 unique samples from cloud storage hosted by threat actors conducting the campaign. Most samples displayed few detections in Virustotal. Sophos has published IoCs (indicators of compromise) to their GitHub repository.\nSophos’ principal threat researcher Andrew Brandt shared the following comment with Hackread.com on the malspam campaign, explaining the risks it entails for the hospitality industry.\n“An attack like this, that takes advantage of well-meaning hospitality managers, could not only cause problems for the hotel but also the guests staying there. Hotel managers hold (in some cases, literally) the keys to everything that happens on the premises, and their passwords give them access to a lot of non-public information about staff, guests and visitors. \n“The malware used in these attacks isn’t particularly sophisticated. Once the criminals behind these attacks have stolen passwords, they can use these credentials to gain access to additional hotel assets or sell the credentials to other criminals. While this attack is aimed squarely at hotel managers, the compromised privacy of hotel guests – general consumers – is collateral damage.”\n“Guests rely on the discretion of hotel staff for a variety of reasons, but an attack like this takes away the hotel staff’s ability to protect customers from cybercriminals who could misuse the stolen credentials. Hotel staff and front-line managers should be on alert for the unique and unusual characteristics of this attack. In addition, they should note that the spammers in this campaign do not have, and (when asked) will refuse to provide reservation details in the body of the message but may attempt to convince hotel employees that such information is embedded in the linked, malicious archive file.\n“In situations where the person contacting the hotel refuses to provide basic information in the message itself, such as the name of the registered guest, their dates of stay, or reservation number, be wary. The use of password-protected archive files as a delivery method is another giveaway that something is seriously amiss.\n“Hotel IT managers should deploy multi-factor authentication everywhere it is practical and push policies to Windows computers that change the default setting in Windows that conceal the file suffix for known file types. That way security teams can deliver training and messaging about file extensions (.exe or .scr, among others) that are dangerous for staff to open. And finally, all computers used to communicate with guests should have adequate endpoint protection software.”\nNew ‘NKAbuse’ Linux Malware Uses Blockchain Technology to Spread\nKaspersky’s Global Emergency Response Team (GERT) has discovered a new multiplatform malware threat that uses innovative tactics to hijack victims. The malware, dubbed NKAbuse, uses New Kind of Network (NKN) technology, a blockchain-powered peer-to-peer network protocol to spread its infection.\nNKAbuse is a Go-based backdoor used as a botnet to target Linux desktops and potentially IoT devices. The malware allows attackers to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks or fling remote access trojans (RATs). \nIt is worth noting that the backdoor relies on NKN for anonymous yet reliable data exchange. For your information, NKN is an open-source protocol that allows peer-to-peer data exchange over a public blockchain with over 60,000 active nodes. It aims to provide a decentralized alternative to client-to-server methods while preserving speed and privacy.\nThe botnet can carry out flooding attacks using the 60,000 official nodes and links back to its C2 (command & control) servers. It features an extensive arsenal of DDoS attacks and multiple features to turn into a powerful backdoor or RAT. \nThe malware implant creates a structure called “Heartbeat” that communicates with the bot master regularly. It stores information about the infected host, including the victim’s PID, IP address, free memory, and current configuration.\nKaspersky researchers uncovered NKAbuse while investigating an incident targeting one of its customers in the finance sector. Further examination revealed that NKAbuse exploits an old Apache Struts 2 vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2017-5638). \nThe vulnerability, as reported by Hackread.com in December 2017, allows attackers to execute commands on the server using a “shell” header and Bash and then execute a command to download the initial script.\nNKAbuse leverages the NKN protocol to communicate with the bot master and send\/receive information. It creates a new account and multiclient to simultaneously send\/receive data from multiple clients. \nThe NKN account is initialized with a 64-character string representing the public key and remote address. Once the client is set up, the malware establishes a handler to accept incoming messages, which contains 42 cases, each performing different actions based on the sent code.\nResearchers observed that attackers exploited the Struts 2 flaw using a publicly available proof of concept exploit. They executed a remote shell script, determining the victim’s operating system and installing a second-stage payload. Using NKAbuse’s amd64 version, the attack achieved persistence through cron jobs.\nNKAbuse has no self-propagation functionality and can target at least eight different architectures, although Linux is the priority. Successful implantation can lead to data compromise, theft, remote administration, persistence, and DDoS attacks.\nFor now, its operators are focusing on infecting devices in Colombia, Mexico, and Vietnam. However, researchers suspect its potential for expansion over time.\nCracked macOS Software Laced with New Trojan Proxy Malware\nCybercriminals have typically been keen on exploiting macOS applications to target Mac users, and this time, they might just have hit the jackpot. According to the latest research from cybersecurity researchers at Kaspersky, threat actors are deploying a novel Trojan Proxy malware in cracked applications, distributed via unauthorized websites. The plan behind this operation is to compromise Mac devices.\nResearchers observed that the campaign’s earliest payload submission on VirusTotal was on April 28, 2023. Further probing revealed that the malware is disguised within popular copyrighted macOS software available on warez sites. \nFor your information, Warez sites are websites that offer copyrighted digital content, such as software, movies, music, ebooks, and games, for free or at a significantly lower price than the original product.\nThe malware allows attackers to build a proxy server network to commit crimes or make profits. When installed, this malware converts computers into anonymous traffic-forwarding terminals, allowing malware operators to perform malicious activities, such as phishing, hacking, or conducting illegal transactions. \n“Attackers can use this type of malware to gain money by building a proxy server network or to perform criminal acts on behalf of the victim: to launch attacks on websites, companies and individuals, buy guns, drugs, and other illicit goods” researchers explained in a blog post.\nInfected applications appear as legitimate cracked software, distributed as .PKG installers rather than the usual disk images. A post-installation script replaces two system files with malicious versions from the app resources and grants them administration permissions. A fake Google configuration file (p.plist) automatically starts the WindowServer malware file as a system process. \nThis binary file was uploaded on VirusTotal on April 28 but wasn’t recognized as malware then. The malware utilizes DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to get the C2 server IP address and connects via WebSockets, receiving commands for the various malicious activities the Trojan can perform and sending information. \nHowever, during their research, investigators didn’t receive a server response beyond the 0x38 command and noted that the client supported TCP and UDP connections. Earlier versions relied on traditional DNS requests instead of DoH for C&C server acquisition.\nIt is worth noting that selling access to these proxies is a highly profitable business, encompassing massive botnets. Kaspersky researchers noted that Mac devices aren’t immune to this deep-rooted threat, which is why this campaign works. \nAttackers are exploiting the popularity of cracked versions of copyrighted software, specifically commercial software\/programs, as users prefer to avoid paying for premium software. \nAround 35 instances of popular image editing, data recovery, video compression and editing, and network scanning tools-related apps laced with Trojan Proxy were identified by Kaspersky.\nBeyond macOS, researchers have identified Android and Windows versions connecting to the same C&C server. This means a larger distribution network for cracked software laced with Trojan Proxy malware could be at work.\nMenlo Security’s chief security architect, Lionel Litty, shared with Hackread.com that using DoH and WebSocket indicates that threat actors are focusing more on evading network-based detection mechanisms.\n“The use of DoH and WebSocket shows that more sophisticated bad actors are focused on evading network-based detection mechanisms an enterprise may have deployed,” Litty explained.\n“DoH will often mean the malware can evade detection from products that look at DNS traffic for IOCs since DNS traffic is now wrapped within HTTPS connections that may not be inspected or that are inspected by solutions that do not understand DoH semantics,” Litty added.\n“Likewise, network devices that inspect HTTPS traffic may not understand WebSocket semantics and may fail to run signature-based detections that target the payloads of C&C traffic used by the malware” Litty warned.\nThousands of WordPress Websites Hacked with New Sign1 Malware\nCybersecurity researchers at Sucuri have uncovered a concerning new malware campaign targeting WordPress websites. Dubbed “Sign1,” the malware injects malicious code into vulnerable websites, ultimately redirecting visitors to scam sites or bombarding them with unwanted pop-up ads.\nThe new malware discovery emerged shortly after Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. disclosed a malicious campaign named FakeUpdates, which specifically targeted WordPress websites with malware.\nSign1 malware’s stealthy tactics make it a significant threat. The malware leverages time-based randomization to generate dynamic URLs, making it difficult for security software to identify and block them. Additionally, the code itself is obfuscated, further hindering detection.\nPerhaps most concerning is Sign1’s ability to target visitors from specific websites, such as popular search engines and social media platforms. This suggests a level of sophistication, potentially allowing attackers to focus on users they deem more susceptible to scams.\nSucuri’s report estimates that over 39,000 WordPress websites have been infected with Sign1 thus far. Website owners are urged to take immediate action to protect their sites and visitors.\nIf you are using WordPress as your website’s content management system (CMS), here are some simple yet vital steps to protect the website from Sign1 and other similar malware:\nWebsite owners who suspect their site may be infected with Sign1 malware should:\nNevertheless, the discovery of Sign1 malware goes on to show the vulnerable state of websites. With more than 835 million sites using WordPress even a small threat could end up compromising a staggering number of sites.\nIt’s crucial to stay informed about the latest security vulnerabilities and take proactive steps to protect your website. Security researchers like Sucuri play a vital role in identifying and mitigating these threats.\nNew XorDdos-Linked Linux RAT Krasue Targeting Telecom Firms\nGroup-IB, a leading cybersecurity company, has uncovered a sophisticated new Linux RAT (Remote Access Trojan) they have dubbed “Krasue.” The malware is actively targeting organizations, mainly telecommunication firms, in Thailand and has been active since 2021.\nGroupIB’s Threat Intelligence unit researchers found that Krause operates by gaining access to the targeted network and uses its rootkit capabilities to maintain persistence and ensure stealthy access. \nThe researchers are still investigating the initial infection vector and the full scale of the RAT’s usage. However, they believe that potential methods include vulnerability exploitation, deceptive downloads, and credential brute force attacks.\nA notable feature of Krause is that it uses the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) for communication with its C2 server. This is an unusual tactic and is most likely used to evade detection by security software.\nReport author Sharmine Low, Group-IB’s Malware Analyst, wrote that Krause is named after a nocturnal spirit mentioned in Southeast Asian folklore. It lets cybercriminals remotely access and control compromised systems and remain undetected for a significant period.\nKrasue uses multiple embedded rootkits to ensure compatibility with different Linux kernel versions. Interestingly, as with several other Linux rootkits, Krasue’s rootkit draws its functionalities from publicly available sources, specifically incorporating code from three open-source Linux Kernel Module rootkits. \nThis embedded rootkit can hook key system calls like kill(), network-related functions, and file listing operations to effectively mask its presence and evade detection. Researchers believe that this RAT was created by the same person who developed the XorDdos Linux Trojan or someone who has access to its source code.\nBenyatip Hongto, Group-IB’s Business Development Manager in Thailand, highlighted the company’s commitment and proactive efforts to fighting cybercrime, including the planned opening of a Digital Crime Resistance Center in Thailand and their partnership with leading cybersecurity distributor nForce.\nUpon discovering Krause, Group-IB researchers promptly notified their Threat Intelligence customers and published a report with YARA rules, which was shared with Thai authorities including ThaiCERT and TTC-CERT.\nThis revelation underscores the ever-looming threat of cyber risks and the need for strong cybersecurity measures. Organizations must be aware of threats like Krause and implement suitable security measures like strict access control, regular patching, and advanced threat detection solutions.\nSophisticated Booking.com Scam Targeting Guests with Vidar Infostealer\nCybersecurity firm Secureworks is alerting Booking.com customers to a recently identified scam wherein hotels’ Booking.com accounts are compromised to deceive users into divulging their payment details. \nThis fraudulent activity was detected in October 2023. Researchers have observed that cybercriminals successfully obtained access to hotel login credentials through the utilization of the Vidar information stealer.\nWhile this tool is not commonly employed in such scams, in this instance, the Vidar infostealer is utilized to infiltrate the hotel’s Booking.com portal. This unauthorized access enables cybercriminals to peruse upcoming bookings and communicate directly with guests while posing as hotel staff.\nResearchers from Secureworks Counter Threat Unit™ (CTU) suspect that this may be part of a broader campaign specifically aimed at targeting Booking.com users. The purloined data is presumed to be traded on underground marketplaces or forums, where it can command a higher price due to the increased potential for defrauding unsuspecting guests.\nCharacterizing it as a sophisticatedly crafted scam, researchers highlight that the hackers devised an email aimed at gaining the trust of hotel employees. The deceptive message purportedly originated from a former guest who reported losing their ID or other valuables, seeking assistance from the hotel staff to locate the items. \nThe subtlety of this approach meant the employee did not find it suspicious, especially since the email lacked attachments or dubious links, creating the illusion of a genuine request. Consequently, the employee responded and offered assistance. \nHowever, a link within the email, allegedly containing a photo of the lost item, actually served to install the Vidar infostealer. Once activated, this malware illicitly acquires the hotel’s Booking.com login credentials, facilitating unauthorized access to guest reservation details.\nThe hook in this scam creates a sense of urgency for the guests. The attacker contacts those having reservations at the hotel through Booking.com. Guests receive urgent emails from the hotel demanding immediate payment confirmation to avoid booking cancellation. This doesn’t raise any suspicions. \nRather, it panics the guests, and they click on the provided link. According to Secureworks’ report, this leads them to a fake website designed to look like Booking.com, which was created to steal their payment data.\nThe scammers scam the guests by draining their accounts using the stolen payment data. Moreover, they sell Booking.com credentials on the Dark Web for up to $2,000.\nAlthough Booking.com hasn’t been directly breached, the company is cooperating with impacted hotels to improve security and help affected customers. The company emphasized using machine learning to detect suspicious activity and advised hotels and customers to stay vigilant and never provide payment details without verifying the website.\n“Due to the rigorous controls and the machine learning capabilities we employ, we can detect and block the overwhelming majority of suspicious activity before it impacts our partners or customers. We have also been sharing additional tips and updates with our partners about what they can do to protect themselves and their businesses, along with the latest information on malware and phishing so that they are as up-to-date as possible on the latest trends that we’re seeing.”\n“It’s good to remember that no legitimate transaction will ever require a customer to provide their credit card details by phone, email, or text message (including WhatsApp)”, Booking.com stated.\nThis incident highlights the evolving tactics of cybercriminals and the importance of vigilance, even for seemingly harmless requests. Hotels should be especially cautious of suspicious emails and enable multi-factor authentication on Booking.com and other platforms to add an extra layer of security. \nChris Hauk, Consumer Privacy Advocate at Pixel Privacy, shared his comments with Hackread.com, stating that this scam is designed to target hotels with good reputations.\n“This scam preys on hotels that offer good customer service, making the hotel employees believe that they are aiding a customer in retrieving a lost item. This is the first time I’ve heard of scammers taking that approach. The second step in the scam involves using a customer’s Booking.com information to convince the customer that they need to make a payment immediately.”\n“Organizations like Booking.com need to work with their partners to ensure that all systems and applications are kept up to date to close security holes. Also, employee training to make them aware of how scammers work is also a must” Hauk added.\nStellar Cyber Bridges Cybersecurity Skills Gap with First-of-Its-Kind University Program\nSAN JOSE, CA – December 4, 2023 – Today, Stellar Cyber, the innovator of Open XDR technology, announced the launch of its University Program – the only invitation-only program for educational organizations that dedicate themselves to developing the next generation of cybersecurity professionals and provide not-for-profit security operations services to underserved communities. \nThe program includes access to technology, curriculum and security experts within the Stellar Cyber ecosystem. This program aims to help educational organizations and underserved communities, both of which lack ready access to the tools, technology and other resources required to teach and defend against cybersecurity attacks.\n“All too often, students graduate from college without being exposed to the fantastic career opportunities in the cybersecurity industry,” said Paul Levasseur, Vice President of Customer and Partner Enablement at Stellar Cyber. “We want to ensure that students understand the exciting and enriching opportunity that exists in cybersecurity so they can make more informed decisions about their future.” \nIn addition to enabling educational organizations to train future cybersecurity professionals, the University Program helps those students provide much-needed cybersecurity services to communities that lack the budget and resources to build and maintain a security operations team. \nIn 2023, the cybersecurity skills gap has emerged as a critical issue, casting a shadow over the escalating turf of online threats and cyber conflicts. As technology advances, so does the complexity of cyberwarfare, transcending geographical boundaries and involving various entities, both allies and adversaries. \nThis widening gap in cybersecurity expertise is particularly concerning in the face of evolving challenges, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive solutions to bridge this disparity and fortify defences against the diverse range of cyber threats emanating from all corners of the globe.\n“Attackers look for targets that cannot easily defend themselves,” Levasseur added. “Our hope is to ensure that these previously underserved communities get the protection they deserve.” \nThe University Program includes the following:\n“Stellar Cyber is proud to offer this comprehensive, collaborative education program free of charge for those training our cyber warriors of the future,” said Jim O’Hara, Chief Revenue Officer at Stellar Cyber. “We are honoured to do our part to help shrink the worldwide cybersecurity skills gap and provide security services to communities in need.

This technique has not been observed in any malware previously. FjordPhantom propagates through messaging services and combines app-based malware with social engineering to deceive banking customers.\nPromon indicated in its report published on November 30, 2023, that only one sample of FjordPhantom has been obtained. However, researchers suspect that the malware is operational in Southeast Asia, encompassing countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, and Vietnam.\n“In discussions with banks in the region, Promon has learned that one customer was defrauded out of 10 million Thai Baht (approximately $280,000 – £225,000) at the time of writing,” noted the report author Benjamin Adolphi and shared with Hackread.com ahead of publication on Thursday.\nFurther probing revealed that the malware is distributed through emails, SMS messages, and messaging apps. Users are tricked into downloading a bogus banking app, which contains FjordPhantom. \nWhen this app gets installed, the attackers, posing as customer service representatives, guide the users about the steps to run the app. The malware uses virtualization to create a virtual container to run this app and attackers can monitor the user’s actions and steal their credentials.\nThe malware integrates various open-source\/free projects from GitHub, incorporating a virtualization solution and a hooking framework. FjordPhantom utilizes virtualization solutions to circumvent the Android sandbox, enabling different apps to operate within the same sandbox. \nThis facilitates attackers in gaining access to files and memory, conducting debugging, and injecting code into other apps. The approach involves virtualization solutions loading their code into a new process before loading the hosted app’s code. Consequently, the malware can evade traditional code injection detection methods, as it doesn’t modify the original application.\nThe malware leverages the hooking framework to evade SafetyNet rooting detection, screenreader detection, and dismiss dialogue boxes warning the user of ongoing malicious activity on the system. Additionally, the malware logs various actions performed by the targeted applications, signifying active development and suggesting potential targeting of other apps in the future.\nResearchers believe that FjordPhantom is a sophisticated Android malware used to commit real-world fraud. \nGoogle has responded to the news published by Hackread.com. In an exclusive statement to the site, a Google spokesperson said that Android users are protected against threats such as the FjordPhantom malware due to the Google Play Protect feature.\n“Users are protected by Google Play Protect, which can warn users or block apps known to exhibit malicious behaviour on Android devices with Google Play Services, even when those apps come from sources outside of Google Play.” \nNevertheless, here are 5 tips for Android users to protect themselves from malware, especially banking trojans:\nHamas-Linked Group Revives SysJoker Malware, Leverages OneDrive\nAmid the escalating tensions in the Israel-Hamas conflict, Check Point Research’s (CPR) team has unearthed a new variant of a multi-platform backdoor SysJoker. According to CPR, which has been monitoring the cybersecurity activities in the two countries, SysJoker malware was used by a Hamas-affiliated APT (advanced persistent threat) group to target Israel recently.\nFor your information, SysJoker was discovered by Intezer in 2021. It is a multi-platform backdoor, which means it can target Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. The malware has been under active evolution since its discovery and today it is equipped with a range of tactics to evade detection. The new SysJoker variant is written in Rust language.\nIn their technical report, CPR researchers noted that the malware code has been rewritten completely but the malware still maintains its original functionalities. The primary modification is that instead of Google Drive, the Rust variant utilizes OneDrive to store dynamic C2 URLs.\nSysJoke features two different modes for string decryption. The first method is rather simple and part of many SysJoker variants. It entails multiple base64-encoded encrypted data blobs and a base64-encoded key. \nWhen decrypting, it decodes both base64 blobs and XORs them to produce plain text strings. The second method is much more complex and involves generating a complex string decryption algorithm.\nIn its report shared with Hackread.com ahead of publication on Tuesday, cybersecurity researchers at Check Point Research revealed that “The infrastructure used in this campaign is configured dynamically. First, the malware contacts a OneDrive address, and from there, it decrypts the JSON containing the C2 address with which to communicate. The C2 address is encrypted with a hardcoded XOR key and base64-encoded.”\nThe report offers in-depth insights on the Rust variant of SysJoker and its Windows variants with their attributions along with infection vectors, the C2 communication mechanism, and malware’s functionalities, which include downloading\/uploading files, executing commands, and capturing screenshots.\n“It is important to mention that in previous SysJoker operations, the malware also had the ability not only to download and execute remote files from an archive but also to execute commands dictated by the operators. This functionality is missing in the Rust version,” researchers noted.\nResearchers found evidence of the malware’s ties to Gaza Cybergang as they have used it in their previous campaigns. They also found behavioural similarities between SysJoker’s new variants and the Operation Electric Powder campaign, which crippled Israeli organizations in 2016-2017. \nThis campaign was also loosely connected to Gaza Cybergang. This gang is reportedly pro-Palestine and often launches attacks to safeguard Palestinian interests. Nevertheless, the resurgence of SysJoker malware adds to the arsenal of cyberweapons employed by hacktivists. Before this incident, Hamas hackers were discovered using a new Linux malware named BiBi-Linux Wiper against Israeli targets.\nKinsing Crypto Malware Targets Linux Systems via Apache ActiveMQ Flaw\nCybersecurity researchers at Trend Micro have identified cybercriminals exploiting a critical vulnerability in Apache ActiveMQ (CVE-2023-46604) to infect Linux systems with the Kinsing malware (also known as h2miner). This vulnerability enables attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems, installing cryptocurrency miners and rootkits.\nThe Kinsing malware poses a significant threat to Linux-based systems, infiltrating servers and rapidly spreading across networks. It exploits vulnerabilities in web applications or misconfigured container environments to gain access, specifically targeting Linux systems. Its primary objectives include cryptocurrency mining, such as Bitcoin, and establishing persistence on the infected host.\nInterestingly, the malware detects and eradicates competing cryptocurrency miners, targeting processes, active network connections, and crontabs that exploit vulnerabilities like WebLogic or Log4Shell. This strategic approach allows the malware to gain complete control of the system’s resources.\nFurthermore, it ensures persistence by adding a cronjob to download and execute its malicious bootstrap script every minute, ensuring the latest malicious Kinsing binary is consistently available on the infected host.\n“Kinsing doubles down on its persistence and compromise by loading its rootkit in \/etc\/ld.so.preload, which completes a full system compromise,” researchers noted.\nRecently, attackers using Kinsing malware have utilized high-profile vulnerabilities like CVE-2023-4911 (Looney Tunables).\nSince early November 2023, Trend Micro researchers observed that CVE-2023-46604 is being exploited. It is a critical severity vulnerability assigned a CVSS score of 9.8. The vulnerability stems from OpenWire commands failing to validate throwable class type, thus enabling RCE.\n“When the marshaller fails to validate the class type of a Throwable, it inadvertently allows the creation and execution of instances of any class. This opens the door to remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected server or application,” Trend Micro researchers explained in a blog post.\nApache ActiveMQ is a popular open-source message and integration platform written in Java. It implements message-oriented middleware (MOM) and facilitates communication between different applications. It offers different features, including OpenWire, STOMP, and Jakarta Messaging (JMS). OpenWire is a binary protocol designed for MOM and serves as the native wire format for ActiveMQ. It offers several benefits, such as bandwidth efficiency and support for various message types.\nThe Kinsing malware exploits the CVE-2023-46604 vulnerability discovered in Apache ActiveMQ, which enables remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the impacted system. After gaining access to the vulnerable server and executing the Kinsing binary, it becomes possible to install rootkits and cryptominers, steal sensitive data, disrupt operations, and install malware.\nApache ActiveMQ versions 5.18.0 before 5.18.3, 5.17.0 before 5.17.6, and 5.16.0 before 5.16.5 are vulnerable to this attack. Apache ActiveMQ has released patches for all affected versions. Users are advised to update their ActiveMQ installations as soon as possible. In addition, keep OpenWire disabled if not required, restrict access to ActiveMQ management interfaces and isolate ActiveMQ deployments through network segmentation to stay protected.\nKen Dunham, Director of Cyber Threat at Foster City, Calif.-based Qualys, a disruptive cloud-based IT, security and compliance solutions provider, shared with Hackread.com that there’s a dire need for proper configuration of the cloud platform.\n“The main takeaway I get here is around how the cloud is rarely configured properly and malware is exploiting that. We don’t want to allow malware like this to be proof of poor configurations and lack of security in our systems, especially around lateral movement tools, tactics and procedures (TTPs) used by the group.”\nDunham noted that Kinsing has been a significant threat since 2020.\n“Kinsing has successfully preyed upon poorly authenticated and configured cloud Docker containers dating back to 2020, then performing lateral movement attempts leveraging brute force attacks,“ Dunham explained. \nIrfan Asrar, Director, of Malware and Threat Research at Qualys, told Hackread.com that researchers have discovered a major gap in the cloud.\n“This discovery highlights a major gap in the cloud not commonly defended against; most web apps\/cloud infrastructure are not scanning for malware in their cloud infrastructure, mostly just attempting to screen web traffic, which allows the Kinsing malware to take advantage and gain persistency. I see this gap being taken advantage of in the future by other groups.”\nKonni RAT Exploiting Word Docs to Steal Data from Windows\nCybersecurity researchers at FortiGuard Labs have discovered a new malware campaign dubbed ‘Konni,’ which targets Windows systems through Word documents containing malicious macros. When unsuspecting users open or download the document, a remote access trojan (RAT) called Konni is executed.\nThe Konni RAT is a sophisticated malware incorporating self-defence mechanisms, with capabilities that include stealing login credentials, remote command execution, and the ability to execute commands with elevated privileges. Additionally, it can download and upload files.\nIt is worth noting that the Konni RAT is known for its previous targeting of Russia. Notably, it was the same malware used against North Korea following its missile tests in August 2017.\nAs for the latest campaign, the malicious Word document is written in the Russian language, and distributed as a legitimate file, such as invoices, contracts, or job applications, to trick users into opening them. \nEven though the document was created in September 2023, FortiGuard Labs’ internal telemetry shows that the campaign’s C2 server remains active. This means the campaign is ongoing, and new victims are being infected. This continuous activity shows the persistent nature of the Konni campaign.\nResearchers observed that a ‘sophisticated threat actor’ has employed an advanced toolset within a Word document using ‘batch scripts and DLL files.’ The payload contains a UAC bypass encrypted communication with a C2 server, probably to allow the actor to execute privileged commands\nUpon opening the Word document, a prompt requests the user to enable content, triggering a VBA script. This script initiates the download and execution of a ‘check.bat’ batch script. The ‘check.bat’ script conducts various checks, including verifying the presence of a remote connection session, identifying the Windows operating system version, and checking the system architecture.\nSubsequently, the script executes the ‘wpns.dll’ library, bypassing UAC (User Account Control), and exploits the legitimate Windows utility ‘wusa.exe’ to launch a command with elevated privileges.\nAfterwards, it runs the ‘netpp.bat’ batch script with inherited elevated privileges. The script stops the ‘netpp’ service, copies necessary files to the ‘System32’ directory, and creates a service named ‘netpp” that automatically starts at system startup. The malware begins execution after adding registry entries and starting the “netpp” service.\nAccording to the FortiGuard Labs blog post, Konni RAT can extract information and execute commands on infected devices. Once installed, it lets attackers control the infected system remotely to steal sensitive data, deploy additional malware, or perform unauthorized activities. \nThe malware fetches a list of active processes on the system, and after performing compression and encryption, it sends the data to the C2 server. It also downloads a payload or command from the C2 server by sending an HTTP request. When it receives a response, it extracts and decrypts the data, stores it as a temporary file and executes the cmd command to expand the payload and initiate further actions.\nThe latest findings should not come as a surprise, considering that, as of 2022, the Microsoft Office Suite remains the most exploited set of tools by hackers for spreading malware.\nThe Konni campaign has been observed targeting individuals and organizations worldwide, particularly those in the Middle East and North Africa. To protect yourself from the Konni campaign and similar malware attacks, avoid opening email attachments from unknown senders or emails with suspicious subject lines. \nAdditionally, disable macros in Word documents and enable only when you know the document’s origin and purpose. Lastly, ensure your operating system and applications are updated to the latest versions to address known security vulnerabilities.\nPopular Dragon Touch Tablet for Kids Infected with Corejava Malware\nRetailers like Amazon have played a significant role in popularizing low-cost Android devices for children. However, based on research conducted by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) on such devices, there is a possibility that they may contain malware.\nEFF’s researchers examined the Dragon Touch KidzPad Y88X 10 tablet from Amazon and discovered not only malware but also preinstalled riskware, along with an outdated parental control app called KIDOZ. Following the EFF’s investigations, Amazon removed the product from the platform. However, other Y88X models are still being sold on the site.\nIt is worth noting here that Amazon devices frequently face criticism due to the presence of preinstalled malware. In January 2023, the company gained attention for selling a T95 Android TV box that harboured sophisticated, persistent, and preinstalled malware embedded in its firmware. \nDespite awareness of the issue, Amazon continued to sell these compromised devices until February 2023. In both instances, the devices were also infected by the same Corejava malware.\nThe Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is Google’s open-sourced Android operating system. Consequently, most Android devices available for purchase come equipped with AOSP, featuring multiple customization layers, commonly referred to as AOSP’s ‘skinned’ version.\nIn addition to beneficial features, these customized versions can facilitate the inclusion of undesired apps or bloatware. For instance, in 2019, Samsung pre-installed the Facebook app on its phones, allowing users only the option to disable it; however, it was later revealed to be a placeholder app. Nevertheless, in more malicious instances, customized versions can come with preinstalled malware.\nThat is precisely the case with the Dragon Touch Tablet. Researchers discovered that it harboured the notorious Corejava malware, as evidenced by the presence of directories such as “\/data\/system\/Corejava” and “\/data\/system\/Corejava\/node” in the tablet’s firmware. These directories indicated the active presence of Corejava on the device. Another red flag was the inclusion of links to other manufacturers and unusual requests originating from the tablet.\nResearchers initially powered on the tablet after the C2 servers of Corejava were taken down to prevent any attempts to download malicious payloads. However, the absence of any noticeable activity suggested a residual remnant of the malware, resembling a ‘copied homework,’ possibly a result of hurried production or left for potential future activities.\nMoreover, this tablet was preloaded with Adups, which serve as “firmware over the air” (FOTA) update software and is also found on Android TV boxes. It was incorporated into the system under the name “Wireless Update.” \nAdups is classified as malware, although there are supposedly “clean versions,” and one such version was present on this tablet. Adups comes preinstalled with the Dragon Touch OEM, and even after a factory reset, the application reappears, making it impossible to uninstall or disable.\nResearchers also noted a significant correlation between Android TV box sellers and the Dragon Touch tablet. The group had registered multiple brands and shared an address with the tablet on Walmart. This led to the conclusion that all devices associated with this seller should undergo thorough scrutiny.\nThe Dragon Touch tablet is equipped with an outdated KIDOZ app that is apparently adware. Despite being COPPA Certified, this app functions as a mini operating system. Notably, its referrer, Tablet Express, is no longer operational. \nThis suggests that Dragon Touch has repurposed an old version of the app, which continues to collect and send data to Kidoz.net. The information includes details such as device model, brand, country, screen size, timezone, click events, view events, logtime of events, and the unique KID ID.\nFurthermore, researchers discovered that the app Kids Paint FREE transmits precise GPS coordinates to an ad server, even though the server itself does not exist. This raises concerns about the privacy and security implications of the tablet’s preinstalled applications.\n“This leakage of device-specific information over primarily HTTP (insecure) web requests can be targeted by bad actors who want to siphon information either on the device or by obtaining these defunct domains,” EFF blog post read.\nDespite Amazon’s efforts to combat fake reviews, the marketplace giant needs to do more to address the escalating cybersecurity concerns, particularly when the targets are vulnerable children.\nDdostf Botnet Resurfaces in DDoS Attacks Against MySQL and Docker Hosts\nAhnLab Security Emergency Response Center (ASEC) researchers have shared alarming details of a new campaign targeting MySQL servers and Docker hosts with DDoS malware.\nAhnLab noted that attacks targeting MySQL servers on Windows systems have increased sharply, and vulnerable servers are infected with the Chinese botnet Ddostf, discovered in 2016. \nResearchers claim that this malware is specifically designed for launching DDoS attacks and that the threat actor is operating a DDoS-for-hire service.\nAccording to the AESC blog post, threat actors scan for exploitable MySQL servers. After compromising the servers, threat actors install the Ddostf DDoS botnet to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against other servers.\nMySQL servers are a common target in such campaigns because of their widespread use in Windows and Linux environments. Although MS-SQL is a preferred database service for Windows users, MySQL servers are also commonly used on Windows, which makes the systems running them a prime target for cybercriminals.\nBased on data from AhnLab’s Smart Defense (ASD) logs, most malware targeting vulnerable MySQL servers were Gh0st RAT variants, but instances of AsyncRAT were also observed and recently, there’s been an uptick in the use of the Ddostf botnet.\nDdostf is a powerful malware that copies itself with a random name in the %SystemRoot% directory and registers as a service before decrypting the encrypted C2 server URL string to connect to the attackers’ server. It can collect system data and transfer it to the C2 server. Then it waits for specific commands (e.g., SYN, UDP, and HTTP GET\/POST floods) to launch the DDoS attacks.\nThe botnet is unique because it can connect to a new address from the C2 server and execute commands there for a limited time. This helps the Ddostf botnet operator to infect multiple systems and sell DDoS attacks as a service. Ddostf can target Linux and Windows systems because of supports both ELF and PE formats and can achieve persistence. \nAttackers first scan for publicly accessible systems using port 3306\/TCP and after accessing the server (those with known vulnerabilities or weak credentials), they use brute-force or dictionary attacks on the system. \nIf the system has signs of poor credential management, attackers can gain access to administrator account credentials. If the system runs an unpatched version with vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them to execute commands without needing these processes. Unlike MS-SQL, which entails direct OS command execution methods, MySQL relies on UDFs (User-Defined Functions) that can allow threat actors to execute commands.\nThey can also install malicious UDF DLLS on infected MySQL servers and execute commands. Like CLR Stored Procedure WebShell work, these DLLs can provide threat actors complete control of the infected system. In the case of the Ddostf DDoS bot, attackers use the UDF malware as a tool to install it on poorly managed MySQL servers.\nDatabase servers get frequently targeted because of poorly managed account credentials. Administrators must use strong passwords apart from applying the latest patches to protect their servers. Firewalls can be used to restrict access to external actors, and a DDoS mitigation service can help protect against large-scale attacks.\nOperator of Major Proxy Botnet ‘IPStorm’ Arrested, Pleads Guilty in US\nA Russian-Moldovan national has pleaded guilty to operating an illegal botnet proxy service called IPStorm, responsible for infecting thousands of internet-connected devices worldwide. \nSergei Makinin, 32, of Moscow, Russia, was arrested by the F.B.I. with the cooperation of law enforcement authorities in Spain and Bitdefender, which provided cybersecurity consulting, resources, and guidance to track the suspect.\nMakinin pleaded guilty to “three counts of violating 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5)(A) Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Computers,” in a district court in Puerto Rico as per the U.S. Department of Justice press release.\nMakinin was suspected of running an extensive botnet-for-rent operation called Interplanetary Storm (IPStorm) used for illegal activities from June 2019 through December 2022. Bitdefender first documented the operation in a research paper in October 2020.\nThe botnet targeted Windows, Linux, Mac, and Android devices and claimed victims in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. IPStorm anonymized its users’ internet traffic, allowing them to conduct malicious activities such as hacking, identity theft, and fraud.\nThe IPStorm malware allowed Makinin hijack the devices and use them as a proxy. Cybercriminals preferred the service because it was inexpensive, easy to use, and effectively anonymized their internet traffic. Makinin also admitted to developing\/distributing malware for infecting the devices, earning $550,0000, and laundering the money.\nMakinin is the first to be charged in connection with IPStorm. He faces up to 10 years in prison and will have to forfeit the cryptocurrency wallets linked with the scam. The sentencing is yet to be scheduled. Meanwhile, the F.B.I. and DoJ will continue to investigate the service.\nCommenting on this development is the operation’s lead researcher and Bitdefender’s Investigation and Forensics Unit’s senior director, Alexandru Catalin Cosoi. Cosoi shared with Hackread.com that IPStorm was a “complex” botnet rented by cybercriminals for various nefarious activities:\n“The Interplanetary Storm botnet was complex and used to power various cybercriminal activities by renting it as a proxy as a service system over infected IoT devices. Our initial research back in 2020 uncovered valuable clues to the culprit behind its operation, and we are extremely pleased it helped lead to arrests,” Cosio explained. \n“This investigation is another primary example of law enforcement and the private cybersecurity sector working together to shut down illegal online activities and bring those responsible to justice.”\nMakinin’s conviction is a significant victory for law enforcement in the fight against cybercrime. Botnet proxy services remain a serious threat because they are used to committing cybercrimes. This development sends a strong message to other cybercriminals that they will be held accountable for their actions sooner or later.\nNew AcidRain Linux Malware Variant “AcidPour” Found Targeting Ukraine\nResearchers at SentinelLabs have uncovered a new variant of the Acid Rain malware, dubbed “Acid Pour,” which has emerged in Ukraine. The discovery was made over the weekend, with J. A. Guerrero-Saade, AVP of SentinelLabs, sharing insights via X (formally Twitter).\nThe original AcidRain malware surfaced in March 2022, notably used during the ‘Viasat hack,’ which disrupted KA-SAT Surfbeam2 modems at the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIt's been an interesting weekend! Eagle-eyed @TomHegel spotted what appears to be a new variant of AcidRain. Notably this sample was compiled for Linux x86 devices, we are calling it 'AcidPour'. Those of you that analyzed AcidRain will recognize some of the strings. Analysis 🧵 pic.twitter.com\/wY3PJKaOwK\nTomHegel, Principal Threat Researcher at SentinelLabs, identified the new variant, compiled specifically for Linux x86 devices. While AcidPour shares similarities with AcidRain in certain strings, it separates significantly in its codebase, compiled for x86 architecture rather than MIPS.\nIt is worth noting that popular Linux distros for x86 devices include Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, and Debian. On the other hand, MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages) is a type of instruction set architecture (ISA), which essentially defines the language a processor understands and uses to execute instructions. Similar to x86, it’s a set of rules and specifications for how a processor operates.\nAcidRain operated as a generic wiper, targeting common directories and device paths on embedded Linux distros. AcidPour, however, introduces new elements, referencing Unsorted Block Images (UBI) and virtual block devices associated with Logical Volume Manager (LVM), suggesting a potential expansion of targets beyond previous iterations.\nDespite the similarities, there are notable differences, including a distinct wiping logic for devices like LVMs, indicating a potentially evolved strategy by threat actors. The good news is that SentinelLabs has raised awareness of AcidPour among stakeholders in Ukraine, although the specific targets and scope of the operation remain unclear.\nThe discovery goes on to show how fast malware threats are evolving, with attackers adapting their tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in various systems. From the perspective of an unsuspecting user or an organization in the business, both must keep an eye on cybersecurity threats like AcidRain and AcidPour.\nBegin by prioritizing training for yourself and your employees, as phishing attacks act as a primary gateway for malware infection. Consider leveraging AI-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT or Gemini AI to compile a concise yet essential guide outlining preventive measures against phishing, malware, ransomware, and data breaches.\nOracleIV DDoS Botnet Malware Targets Docker Engine API Instances\nCybersecurity researchers at Cado Security Labs have exposed a novel (Distributed Denial of Service) DDoS botnet malware dubbed OracleIV targeting publicly exposed Docker Engine API instances. \nThe findings were part of an investigation into a malicious campaign exploiting misconfigurations in Docker containers to deliver Python malware, compiled as an ELF executable.\nLately, Docker Engine APIs have been frequent targets of cybercriminals since the method has gained popularity due to the increasing adoption of microservice-driven architectures. Attackers exploit the unintentional exposure of the Docker Engine API, often scanning for vulnerable instances to deliver payloads with nefarious objectives.\nIn the case of the new OracleIV DDoS botnet malware, the attackers initiate access with an HTTP POST request to Docker’s API, specifically the \/images\/create endpoint. This triggers a docker pull command, fetching a specified image from Dockerhub. Once the malicious image is retrieved, a container is launched to carry out the attacker’s objectives.\nCado Security researchers uncovered a live Dockerhub page for an image named “oracleiv_latest” uploaded by the user “robbertignacio328832.” The image, seemingly harmless as a “Mysql image for docker,” included a malicious payload named “oracle.sh,” an ELF executable acting as a DDoS bot agent. Further analysis revealed additional commands to retrieve XMRig and a miner configuration file.\nStatic analysis of the executable exposed a 64-bit ELF compiled with Cython, confirming the OracleIV malware’s Python code origin. The malware code, succinct yet potent, contains various functions dedicated to different DDoS methods.\n“This image was still live at the time of writing and had over 3,000 pulls,” researchers explained in a blog post. Additionally, it seems to be undergoing frequent updates, with the latest modifications pushed just three days prior to the publication of Cado’s blog.\nThe bot connects to a Command and Control server (C2), performing basic authentication with a hardcoded password. Cado Security Labs monitored the botnet’s activity, witnessing DDoS attacks on various targets, primarily using UDP and SSL-based floods.\nThe C2 commands for initiating DDoS attacks follow a specific format, specifying attack type, target IP\/domain, attack duration, rate, and target port. The botnet’s capabilities include UDP floods, SSL-based attacks, SYN floods, slowloris-style attacks, and protocol-specific floods targeting the FiveM server and Valve source engine.\nWhile OracleIV is not a supply chain attack, it highlights the ongoing threat of misconfigured Docker Engine API deployments. The portability of containerization enables attackers to execute malicious payloads consistently across Docker hosts. \nAlthough Cado Security has reported the malicious user to Docker, users are urged to conduct periodic assessments of pulled images from Dockerhub, emphasizing the need for vigilance against malicious code.\nIn conclusion, the OracleIV campaign highlights the importance of securing internet-facing services and implementing strong network defences. Users of Docker and similar services are encouraged to regularly review their exposure and take necessary precautions against potential cybersecurity threats.\nMicrosoft Azure Exploited to Create Undetectable Cryptominer\nCryptomining can cause harm if someone unauthorized does it on a regular person’s device. SafeBreach Labs found that researchers can use trustworthy, widely-used software to mine cryptocurrency without using many resources or incurring costs.\nIn a report shared with Hackread.com ahead of publication on Wednesday, SafeBreach researchers demonstrated this by creating the first completely undetectable cryptominer that operates freely using Microsoft Azure’s Automation service. This service is specifically made to automate cloud-management tasks, eliminating the need for building or maintaining infrastructure. Users only need to provide the scripts for execution.\nIn a blog post by Ariel Gamrian, three methods for running a cryptocurrency miner on Microsoft Azure servers without detection or charges were discovered. SafeBreach Labs’ researchers referred to this as the ultimate cryptominer. \nThey found that the Azure automation service allows the uploading of custom Python packages, which are then utilized within the runbook scripts. Whenever a package is uploaded, the service silently installs it in the background to ensure successful installation and prevent runbook execution problems. The researchers from SafeBreach Labs exploited this behaviour to develop the cryptominer successfully.\n“We knew that code could not be directly executed on a .whl file installation, but we could assume what command was used in the background for installation. We assumed the .whl file would be installed by the pip executable already installed in the Automation Account using the command “pip install “pip install <whl_file>,” explained Gamrian. \n“If our assumptions were correct, we could create a malicious package named “pip” and upload it to the Automation Account. The upload flow would replace the current pip in the Automation account.”\nOnce the custom pip was stored in the Automation account, the service automatically employed it whenever a package was uploaded. Leveraging this flow, the researchers managed to execute code. They ran this in a temporary sandboxed environment, obtaining an access token that represented the Automation Account’s assigned identity. This token allowed them to make requests on behalf of that identity, almost entirely obscuring any trace back to them.\nAdditionally, researchers found that they could achieve code execution by utilizing the Powershell module upload flow. This involved creating a Powershell module file containing the desired code for upload. While exploring the pricing, they discovered that the feature’s pricing details were not documented. \nTo determine the cost, they had to manually identify the code runtime and the associated flow cost. To test this, they initiated 55 import flows simultaneously, which theoretically accounted for approximately 10,000 minutes of runtime considering the three-hour import flow limitation. \nAfter a month, they checked and found they were not charged anything, confirming that their developed cryptominer incurred no charges and was maintenance-free. Subsequently, they developed a tool named CloudMiner, enabling anyone to execute code for free on Azure using the same technique. Users only need to provide the Python or Powershell script they wish to execute and grant access to their Automation Account, and the tool will manage the rest.\nThis research could significantly impact not only crypto mining but also other domains requiring code execution on Azure. Users can obtain cryptocurrency through various means, such as online exchanges, as payment, or by mining virtually. \nMining is a favoured method for earning crypto, involving a network of computers that verify and secure blockchains and digital ledgers recording crypto transactions. Miners are rewarded with new coins within this self-sustaining cycle, making it a preferred avenue for scammers.\nThe researchers reported their findings to the Microsoft Security Response Center, but no Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) were issued. However, the software company acknowledged the issue in their Security Researcher Acknowledgements for Microsoft Online Services. Subsequently, they addressed and resolved the Python 3.10 free runtime issue.\nLazarus-Linked BlueNoroff APT Targeting macOS with ObjCShellz Malware\nJamf Threat Labs’ security experts have discovered a new malware variant attributed to the BlueNoroff APT group. According to the company’s blog post published on 7 November 2023, this campaign, like BlueNoroff’s previous campaigns, seems to be financially motivated. \nThe threat actor has a history of targeting cryptocurrency exchanges, venture capital firms, and banks. BlueNoroff is a subgroup of the larger North Korean state-backed group called Lazarus.\nThe malware, dubbed ObjCShellz, is part of the RustBucket campaign, researchers believe. It is a later-stage malware variant of BlueNoroff’s RustBucket malware, because of their similar characteristics. \nFor your information, a later-stage malware is one that’s executed after the attacker has gained initial access and used for data exfiltration, lateral movement within the network, or maintaining persistence.\nThe malware was discovered while performing routine threat hunting. Further probing revealed that it was a Mach-O universal binary communicating with a domain (swissborgblog registered on May 31, 2023) that the company had previously classified as malicious because it was a fake version of the original domain (swissborg.com). The attackers created a fake crypto exchange website on this fake domain to trick users.\nThe malware is ad-hoc signed and can split its C2 URL into two different strings to evade detection. The IP address researchers detected (104.168.214151) was also linked to the same APT actor from their previous campaigns.\n “We have observed submissions to VirusTotal from countries such as Japan and the US in September and October” researchers noted in their blog post.\nObjCShellz is written in Objective-C, a programming language used for macOS applications. It is used as a macOS implant that establishes C2 communication after infiltrating the device and downloads\/executes multiple payloads. \nObjCShellz is a lightweight malware featuring advanced obfuscation features. It operates as a simple remote shell and executes shell commands received from the C2 server. The malware sends a POST message to the fake URL version and gains information about the malware process before retrieving the operatingSystemVersionString to find out the macOS version.\nResearchers could not determine how initial access was achieved. However, they are sure that this is a later-stage malware used in this multi-stage attack to run remote shell commands manually on Intel and Arm Macs.\nThe threat actor generally reaches out to victims as an investor or creates domains belonging to a legitimate crypto exchange. In this campaign too, the attacker contacts the victims as a head hunter or investor, offering them something beneficial or a partnership. Despite being simple, this malware is very functional and can allow threat actors to carry out a range of malicious objectives.\nHackread.com has observed a continuous surge in attacks against macOS devices and BlueNoroff’s activities. Earlier in November, Elastic Security Labs detected Lazarus group using a new macOS malware dubbed KandyKorn, targeting cryptocurrency users and blockchain engineers. \nBack in 2021, AT&T Alien Labs researchers discovered that threat actors were harnessing malware-infected Macs and Windows devices as proxy exit nodes to reroute proxy requests. In December 2022, Kaspersky researchers reported that BlueNoroff is targeting cryptocurrency-related financial entities worldwide with new, sophisticated malware strains and 70 fake domains of venture capital firms and banks.\nTo protect against ObjCShellz malware, organizations must keep software and operating systems patched against new security flaws, use EDR (endpoint detection and response) solutions to monitor network activities, and employ network segmentation strategies to limit malware distribution by isolating critical systems.\nCybersecurity expert at the California-based Menlo Security browser security provider firm, Mr. Ngoc Bui, shared his findings on the BlueNoroff APT actor exclusively with Hackread.com. Bui noted that it has been active since 2016-2017 and its key targets are financial entities in Europe and North America. \n“BlueNoroff is a North Korean-backed advanced persistent threat (APT) group that has been active since at least 2016\/2017. The group is known for targeting cryptocurrency exchanges, venture capital firms, and banks in North America and Europe,” explained Bui BlueNoroff’s attacks are typically financially motivated, and the group has been known to use a variety of malware and techniques to steal sensitive data and funds from its victims.”\nAbout their malware RustBucket, Bui noted that this backdoor is written in rust and collects basic system details before contacting the C2. \n“RustBucket is a backdoor written in rust. The backdoor collects basic system information and communicates to the URL provided via the command line. Supported backdoor commands include file execution and exit. RustBucket is a malware campaign also attributed to BlueNoroff, first uncovered in 2021. It uses phishing emails posing as job recruiters to infect targets with backdoor malware that can steal data and remotely control infected systems,” Bui said.\nBui believes that Jamf Threat Labs’ discover holds significance because it highlights that the actor is continually improving its malware strains. \n“The discovery of the new malware strain by Jamf Threat Labs is significant because it shows that BlueNoroff is continuing to develop new and sophisticated malware. The fact that the malware was undetected by VirusTotal at the time of uploading suggests that BlueNoroff is taking steps to evade detection. For North Korea, this is a big deal if you have been following the different APTs and activities from that country.”\nBui noted that ObjCShellz is a big threat for macOS users “because it is disguised as legitimate software and can be difficult to detect. The malware can also steal sensitive data, such as cryptocurrency wallets and passwords. And a low detection rate means it may get past AV.”\nColorado-based cybersecurity advisory services provider Coalfire’s vice president Andrew Baratt told Hackread.com that it is hard to draw definite linkages between malware.\n“It’s hard to really draw official linkages between malware that shares commonalities as many disparate threat actors borrow and steal from other malware campaigns. Copying legit sites is a fairly common tactic to evade detection on the C2 side of a malicious capability.” \n“We’ve been pointing out for some time that VirusTotal (VT) is only as good as its first observation time, and if malware authors are building up offline testing capabilities, the time it takes for detection is going to be much more significant. We also potentially have the signs of AI usage creeping into malware development,”  said Baratt.\nHistorically, it can be seen in VT as it has been used as a test run for a piece of malware – as a cross over for detection -then multiple iterations are used until evasion is achieved. The challenge for the malware is that this creates a timeframe and VT, now owned by Google, has a window of advantage to do further analysis. If they’re using generative AI to help modify the malware, there is a real potential for new evasion techniques to be used with a reasonably high degree being under the purview of VT,” Baratt explained.\nIBM X-Force Discovers Gootloader Malware Variant- GootBot\nIBM X-Force has discovered a new variant of the notorious Gootloader malware, dubbed GootBot. This malware performs stealthy lateral movement, which complicates the detection or blocking of the campaign within enterprise networks.\nAccording to the blog post authored by Golo Mühr and Ole Villadsen, the Gootloader group implements their custom bot in the latter stages of this attack chain to evade detection, using off-the-shelf tools for establishing C2 communication, such as RDP or CobaltStrike.\nGootloader malware was initially used only as an initial access tool and evolved considerably over time to include GootBot, a lightweight obfuscated PS script. It is downloaded after the Gootloader infection and receives commands via C2 through encrypted PowerShell scripts.\nFor your information, the Gootloader group (aka UNC2565 or Hive0127) first surfaced in 2014 and focused more on SEO poisoning techniques and compromised WordPress websites to distribute the Gootkit-based Gootloader malware. Tanium’s director of endpoint security research, Melissa Bischoping, explained how SEO poisoning works. \n“SEO poisoning drives users to malicious payloads by manipulating the search results for key terms. Most security awareness training focuses heavily on phishing and other methods where an attacker sends something to the user. There’s a false sense of security that people place in search result top rankings and an outdated mindset that the lock on the address bar means a site is safe.”\nHackread.com has been following the Gootloader group’s activities since its emergence. The group frequently targets business-related online searchers like queries about legal contracts, creating legit-looking websites, and positioning them on the first page of search results. Once the user visits the page, they entice them into downloading archive files, which appear harmless and relevant to their queries but actually contain Gootloader malware.\nIn March 2021, Sophos cybersecurity firm confirmed that Gootloader has evolved into a sophisticated loader framework from serving as an initial access point, revealing that its delivery method had expanded beyond the Gootkit malware family. As an initial access point, Gootloader malware was used by numerous threat groups, including ransomware affiliates and in additional payloads like SystemBC and IcedID.  \nGootBot is a novel Gootloader variant. It is a PowerShell payload encapsulating a single C2 server address. Its strings use a replacement key to conduct mild obfuscation. The malware, just like Gootloader, sends a GET request to the C2 server, requesting PowerShell tasks, and gets a string comprising a Base64-encoded payload. \nThe last 8 digits of the code are the task’s name. It then decodes the payload and injects it into the script block before executing it. The payload runs asynchronously, maintaining a default beaconing interval of 60 seconds. When it receives a C2 task, the next loop iteration starts, and for completed jobs, the results are returned.\nGootBot is designed for lateral movement within the network, noted X-Force researchers. Its C2 infrastructure can quickly generate numerous GootBot payloads for distribution, each having a unique C2 address, and can cause multiple infections of the same host. It also runs a reconnaissance script and contains a unique GootBot ID for the host.\nThis effective malware lets attackers swiftly propagate across the compromised network to deploy additional malicious software. Unlike Gootloader, GootBot spreads through infected domains to reach the domain controller. This indicates a shift in attack tactics from Gootloader operators and enhances the success rate of post-exploitation stages, including Gootloader-based ransomware affiliate activity.\nThe malware is capable of extracting domain user name, and OS details from the registry key, checks for x86 dir and int ptr size if 64bit architecture is detected, and obtains information about domain controllers from registry and ENV var, SID, local IP address, hostname, and running processes. The data gets formatted with the specified ID.\nThe emergence of the GootBot variant highlights that attackers are employing sophisticated methods to stay undetected and spread laterally across the network. Lateral-movement scripts are possible through various techniques, such as WinRM, SMB, and WinAPI calls, to spread the payload to other hosts.\nOrganizations must implement advanced security mechanisms, including endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions and regularly updating software to prevent the threat. Bugcrowd cybersecurity firm’s founder and chief strategy officer, Casey Ellis, shared the following statement with Hackread.com regarding the current Gootloader campaign.\n“This all strikes me as a very organized and thoughtful initial access broker (IAB). Their watering-hole style deployment of malicious SEO isn’t particularly targeted, however, it suits the opportunistic attack model of an IAB quite well. For defenders, it’s important to remember that organized cybercrime is continuing to evolve, stratify, and mature and that the threat actor behaviours now include this type of long, wide game.”\nKeeper Security’s CEO and co-founder, Darren Guccione, in an exclusive statement shared with Hackread.com, noted that it is hard for innocent users to distinguish between authentic and fabricated search results, which makes SEO poisoning so successful.\n“Innocent people who are not trained on SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and SEO-related attack vectors, including SEO poisoning, generally focus on the aesthetics of the search results page they are familiar with such as the domain name and the logos displayed. Often, threat actors will use language like “Official Website” to lure people into clicking a dangerous link or visiting a spoofed site that can download Gootloader or other malware onto their device.”\nHowever, some scrutiny can prove beneficial in detecting malicious websites, said Guccione. “Phony or spoofed websites will usually have a different website address than the official company name and can also use different domain extensions than the one for the legitimate website. The majority of popular websites use the domain extension .com,” explained Guccione. \n“If you visit a site, pay special attention to the domain itself and if it appears to be abnormally long or unrecognizable based on your normal search activity, it’s best to ignore it – and not click on any link. Online tools such as a Google Transparency Report can also be used to determine whether a site is safe.”\nProvocative Facebook Ads Leveraged to Deliver NodeStealer Malware\nCybersecurity researchers at Bitdefender Labs have shared details of a new wave of malware scams targeting Meta’s ad network on Facebook to steal user data via deploying NodeStealer malware.\nIt is an information-stealing tool designed to steal sensitive user\/device data, including browser cookies and passwords. It allows its operators to hijack Facebook, Gmail, Outlook, and other accounts.\nMeta has been under malware attacks, particularly on its Facebook Business accounts network, where malicious actors attempt to steal users’ login credentials and payment information.”\nAccording to Bitdefender’s blog post published on 31 October 2023, Meta’s Ads Manager tool is actively exploited in these scams. Researchers noticed that the campaign targets male users (aged 18-65 but mostly 45+ males) on Facebook, primarily from Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean. \nPer Bitdefender’s research, cybercriminals are now targeting regular Facebook users apart from business accounts. The threat actors use ad credit balances of hacked business accounts to run misleading, malware-infected ads to deliver malware to unsuspecting users.\nThe campaign involves displaying ads featuring provocative photos of young women. For this purpose, attackers have created Facebook pages where they run fake ads featuring a few revealing photos of young women, many of which are AI-generated or photoshopped\/edited. According to researchers, several fake profiles have been performing the same activity. These include:\nThese albums link to Gitlab or Bitbucket repositories that store the archive containing the Windows executable and install a new variant of the NodeStealer infostealer. Attackers also lure users through short descriptions so that they download the media archive. For instance, they post captions like “Watch now before it’s deleted” and “New stuff is online today.”\nWhen an unsuspecting user clicks on the ads or photos, they get redirected to a malicious website and are prompted to download a file titled “Photo Album.” This is an archive file containing the malicious executable.\nFurther, once NodeStealer gets installed on the victim’s device, it starts stealing data such as Facebook account credentials, browser cookies, and other personal data, which attackers then use to hijack the account. Within just ten days, there have been 100,000 potential malware downloads, and a single ad attracted around 15,000 downloads within 24 hours.\nHackread reported a previous campaign where hackers hijacked Facebook business accounts using NodeStealer 2.0 and stole cryptocurrency. This campaign was detected in August by Palo Alto Networks’ Unit 42 researchers. \nIt’s unclear which cybercrime gang is behind the recent campaign. Previous attacks, like those against Meta from Vietnam, raise concern. Caution is advised when clicking ads or accessing websites.\n“The first line of defence against Nodestealer malware, delivered via phishing links, attachments or ads) is to always use a security solution on your device and keep it up to date. Anti-malware and anti-virus software keep you and your devices safe from new and existing threats by detecting malware and safely removing or stopping it from causing any damage,” researchers concluded.\nLazarus Group uses KandyKorn macOS malware for crypto theft\nA new macOS malware dubbed KandyKorn is currently targeting devices of unsuspected cryptocurrency users and blockchain engineers. The malware, KandyKorn, has been linked to the North Korean hacking group Lazarus and was discovered by cybersecurity researchers at Elastic Security Labs.\nLazarus, a North Korean state-backed hacking group, targets cryptocurrency exchanges, investors, and critical Western infrastructure for stealing data and crypto funds. The group is attributed to significantly boosting the North Korean economy by stealing hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years.\nAccording to researchers, KandyKorn malware operators target blockchain engineers of a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Researchers noted that KandyKorn is a stealthy backdoor designed to extract data, file uploading\/downloading, directory listing, process termination, secure deletion, and command execution.\nAccording to Elastic Security Labs’ research, KandyKorn is a sophisticated malware capable of hijacking macOS devices and deploying additional malware. It is distributed via phishing emails that seem to be sent by legitimate sources like cryptocurrency exchanges or blockchain development companies.\nIn a blog post, authored by Colson Wilhoit, Rizardo Ungureanu, Seth Goodwin, and Andrew Pease, researchers wrote that users are tricked into downloading a malicious ZIP archive titled ‘Cross-platform Bridges.zip.’ \nThis file imitates an arbitrage bot created for automated profit generation, but actually, it imports thirteen malicious modules. For your information, an arbitrage bot is a software tool that can generate profits from cryptocurrency rate differences across different platforms.\nOnce the malware is installed on the device, it starts stealing a wide range of data, from cryptocurrency wallet addresses and private keys to transaction history. That’s not all! it can also use the compromised devices to launch attacks against new targets or mine cryptocurrency.\n“We observed the threat actor adopting a technique we have not previously seen them use to achieve persistence on macOS, known as execution flow hijacking.”\nThe execution flow, as noted by Elastic Security Labs, is as follows:\nWhat makes KandyKorn a bigger threat than many other malware is that it is difficult to detect as it uses multiple techniques to evade detection by security processes and antiviruses. \nThe reason KandyKorn operators are explicitly targeting the cryptocurrency community and engineers is that they have access to valuable assets like crypto wallets. Therefore, they automatically become attractive targets.\nmacOS device users must stay alert of this threat and adopt protective measures such as verifying the email source before opening\/downloading any attachment, avoiding checking emails from unknown senders, keeping software and applications up to date, including security applications, antiviruses, and operating system, and using strong passwords with 2FA enabled if possible.\nMozi Botnet Takedown: Who Killed the IoT Zombie Botnet?\nEarlier today on November 1st, 2023, ESET researchers observed a deliberate takedown of the infamous Mozi botnet, one of the largest and most active IoT (Internet of Things) botnets in the world. The takedown was likely carried out by the original Mozi botnet creator, Indian or Chinese law enforcement, perhaps enlisting or forcing the cooperation of the botnet operators.\nThe Mozi botnet was used to launch a variety of attacks, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, web scraping attacks, and click fraud attacks. It was also used to steal data from infected devices, including usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers.\nMozi botnet, known for exploiting vulnerabilities in hundreds of thousands of IoT devices, experienced an unexpected nosedive in activity during August 2023. This unforeseen disappearance, first observed in India on August 8th, 2023, and a week later in China on August 16th, stripped Mozi bots of a substantial part of their functionality, leaving cybersecurity experts puzzled and intrigued. \nThat’s where cybersecurity researchers decided to investigate the takedown of Mozi botnet unveiling a significant breakthrough on September 27th, 2023 by detecting a kill switch within a user datagram protocol (UDP) message. \nAccording to ESET’s report, researchers spotted a control payload lacking the usual encapsulation of BitTorrent’s distributed sloppy hash table (BT-DHT) protocol. This control payload was relayed eight times, instructing the bot to download and install an update via HTTP.\nThe kill switch demonstrated multiple functions, including terminating the original Mozi malware, disabling certain system services, executing device configuration commands, and establishing a similar foothold as the replaced original Mozi file.\n“The demise of one of the most prolific IoT zombie botnets is a fascinating case of cyber forensics, providing us with intriguing technical information on how such botnets in the wild are created, operated, and dismantled,” says ESET researcher Ivan Bešina, who investigated the disappearance of Mozi.\nInterestingly, ESET’s analysis identified two versions of the control payload, with the latest one functioning as an envelope containing the first, incorporating minor modifications. Notably, the latest version contained an added function to ping a remote server, possibly for statistical purposes.\nWhile the reduction in functionality was drastic, the Mozi bots retained persistence, suggesting a calculated takedown. The investigation revealed a strong connection between the botnet’s source code and the used binaries, along with the use of correct private keys to sign the control payload.\nIt is difficult to say for sure. However, there are a few possible explanations. One possibility is that the original Mozi botnet creator took down the botnet. The creator may have done this for a variety of reasons, such as wanting to distance themselves from the botnet’s criminal activities, the botnet was not profitable anymore or wanting to sell the botnet to another party.\nAnother possibility is that Chinese law enforcement took down the botnet. China has been cracking down on cybercrime in recent years, and the takedown of the Mozi botnet could be seen as part of this effort.\nRegardless of who took down the Mozi botnet, the takedown is a positive development for the cybersecurity community. It is a sign that even the largest and most sophisticated botnets can be taken down, and it is a reminder that cybercriminals are not invincible.\n“There are two potential instigators for this takedown: the original Mozi botnet creator or Chinese law enforcement, perhaps enlisting or forcing the cooperation of the original actor or actors. The sequential targeting of India and then China suggests that the takedown was carried out deliberately, with one country targeted first and the other a week later,” explains Bešina.\nIran’s Scarred Manticore Targets Middle East with LIONTAIL Malware\nCheck Point Research (CPR) and Sygnia’s Incident Response Team have uncovered a new Iranian espionage campaign they have tied to the notorious Scarred Manticore threat group. \nIn its technical report titled “From Albanian to the Middle East: The Scarred Manticore is Listening,” it is revealed that the group is using a previously undocumented malware framework called LIONTAIL. This malware uses custom loaders and memory-resident shellcode payloads to blend its malicious functionalities into legitimate network traffic.\nResearchers believe that the primary goal behind this campaign is espionage. This threat actor is among the Iranian actors involved in destructive cyberattacks against the Albanian government infrastructure at the behest of MOIS (Ministry of Intelligence & Security) back in July 2022. CPR claims that this threat group has been active since at least 2019, prefers gaining covert access, and persistently pursues data extraction.\nFurther probing revealed that Scarred Manticore is targeting high-profile organizations in the Middle East in this ongoing espionage campaign, focusing keenly on telecommunication, military, and government entities apart from financial institutions, IT service providers, and NGOs.\nThough the LIONTAIL framework appears unique with no code overlaps with any known malware family detected thus far, the other tools used in the attacks overlap with previously reported attacks. Some of these attacks are linked to the OilRig or OilRig-affiliated clusters but there’s insufficient evidence to link the Scarred Manticore group with OilRig. \nSince 2019, this group has been using a custom toolset to compromise internet-exposed Windows servers in the Middle East. In this particular campaign, CPR has uncovered, that the victims are located in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Jordan, Iraq, Oman, and Israel. \nThe geographic regions targeted in this campaign and Scarred Manticore’s previous activities sharply align with Iranian interests and with the typical victim profile targeted by MOIS-sponsored groups in espionage operations.\nScarred Manticore’s toolset has evolved considerably over time as from open-source web-based proxies, they gradually switched to powerful tools combining open-source and custom components. The Tunna-based web shell is one of the group’s earliest tools, an open-source tool used to tunnel TCP communications over HTTP to let attackers connect to any service on the remote host, even those blocked by firewalls. \nThis actor now uses a range of IIS-based backdoors to target Windows servers, including custom web shells, custom DLL backdoors, and driver-based implants. The custom malware framework LIONTAIL, which CPR dubbed ‘digital chameleon,’ can establish persistence on compromised systems and steal sensitive data without being detected. It uses custom loaders and special codes to remain in the computer’s memory and hijacks the HTTP.sys driver to become a part of the regular network activity.\nThe evolution in Scarred Manticore’s tools and capabilities demonstrates the progress Iranian threat actors have undergone within the past few years because the techniques used in recent campaigns are far more sophisticated than previous ones tied to Iran.\nHamas Hackers Targeting Israelis with New BiBi-Linux Wiper Malware\nCybersecurity experts from Security Joes’ Incident Response team recently stepped forward to aid Israeli companies amid the conflict between Israel and Hamas. During their investigations, they uncovered a concerning discovery: a new type of malware known as the BiBi-Linux Wiper.\nThis malicious software, designed for Linux systems, poses a significant threat. It is a powerful executable file that, if granted root access, can potentially wipe out an entire operating system. What sets it apart is its ability to target specific folders, overwrite files, and concurrently corrupt data using multiple threads, significantly amplifying its impact and speed.\nUnlike other malware types that aim to steal data or demand ransom payments, the BiBi-Linux Wiper takes a different approach. It damages files and operating systems by overwriting data with useless information, rendering the affected files unusable. This kind of destructive software, often termed a “Wiper,” is not entirely new but remains a menacing cybersecurity threat against companies, businesses and unsuspecting users.\nAccording to the company’s blog post, one noteworthy detail is the naming convention used in the malware—each infected file is titled bibi-linux.out. This name, seemingly random, actually holds a political undertone, as “bibi” is a common nickname for the current Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Further exploration into the malware’s inner workings revealed this string hardcoded within its structure, used to generate identifiers for corrupted files.\nThe researchers noted the rarity of this malware; at the time of their investigation, it had only received two detections on VirusTotal, suggesting its newness and limited distribution.\nThe malware, upon execution, produces an excessive amount of output, revealing details about its progress and actions. To address this, threat actors use the “nohup” command, redirecting output to a file and preventing the wiping process from halting even if the console is closed.\nIts use of multiple threads and system calls enables it to corrupt files rapidly and efficiently. The malware follows a pattern, overwriting files with random data, renaming them with a ‘BiBi’ extension, and excluding certain file types crucial for the operating system’s function.\nHamas has displayed a surprising level of sophistication in its cyber warfare tactics, as demonstrated by several incidents in recent years. In 2014, Hamas not only breached the live transmission of Israel’s Channel 10 TV station but also defaced the broadcast by displaying distressing images of Palestinian civilians affected by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.\nIn July 2018, Israel accused Hamas of spying on IDF soldiers using malicious World Cup and dating apps. The group reportedly exploited hundreds of IDF Android devices by luring users with images of attractive women.\nBy February 2020, reports surfaced that Hamas hackers masqueraded as women to deceive IDF personnel into downloading malware. These hackers, posing as women, sent out malware to gather critical information and gain control over the soldiers’ phone functions.\nDespite these cyberattacks attributed to Hamas, other groups have also targeted Israel’s critical infrastructure. AnonGhost, a pro-Palestinian group, not only hacked the Red Alert App, an Israeli rocket alert app but also sent fabricated missile, rocket, and nuclear bomb alerts to Israeli citizens.\nOn October 16th, 2023, researchers identified a fraudulent rocket alert app hosted on a malicious website, distributing malware onto the smartphones of unsuspecting Israeli citizens.\nNonetheless, cybersecurity experts persist in monitoring and analyzing these threats. The readiness of companies to defend against evolving cyber risks remains of utmost importance.\nVietnamese DarkGate Malware Targets META Accounts in the UK, USA, India\nCybersecurity firm WithSecure, formerly F-Secure Business, has uncovered a link between the recent DarkGate malware attacks targeting its customers and Vietnam-based threat actors operating a campaign to hijack Meta business accounts and steal sensitive data.\nAccording to WithSecure’s Detection and Response Team (DRT), multiple infection attempts with DarkGate malware were made against their clients’ organizations in the UK, USA, and India on 4 August 2023. \nThe lure documents, target patterns, themes, delivery methods, and overall attack tactics closely resemble the attack mechanism observed in the recent DuckTail infostealer campaigns. WithSecure has been tracking this infostealer for over a year.\nDarkGate is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that first emerged in cyberspace in 2018. It is usually offered as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) tool to cyber criminals. It is a versatile malware employed in various malicious activities such as cryptojacking, information theft, and ransomware attacks.\nWithSecure researchers analyzed open-source data linked to the DarkGate malware campaign and established links to multiple infostealers. This pattern indicates that the same group or threat actor is launching these attacks. \n“By identifying characteristics of DarkGate malware lures and campaigns, we have been able to find multiple pivot points which lead to other information stealers and malware being used in very similar if not identical campaigns, and it is assessed as likely that the same threat actor group performs these campaigns” read WithSecure’s report.\nThe attack commenced with a file named ‘Salary and new products.8.4.zip.’ Once unwitting users downloaded and extracted it, a VBS script was activated. This script renamed and duplicated the original Windows binary (Curl.exe) to a new location, connecting to an external server to retrieve two additional files: autoit3.exe and a compiled Autoit3 script. Subsequently, the script executed the executable, de-obfuscated, and assembled the DarkGate RAT using strings within the script.\nWithSecure found strong identifiers that helped the company establish links between the two campaigns. They also noted that the attackers used many different malware and infostealers, including Ducktail, Redline Stealer, and Lobshot.\n“Based on what we’ve observed, it is very likely that a single actor is behind several of the campaigns we’ve been tracking that target Meta Business accounts,” stated WithSecure™ Senior Threat Intelligence Analyst Stephen Robinson in a blog post.\nAfter obtaining control of an account, they can perform miscellaneous malicious activities, including distributing malware and conducting frauds. The lures and malicious documents used in the campaigns have similar identifiable metadata, including:\nThese distinctive markets are digital fingerprints, helping researchers link disparate campaigns to a single actor. However, many other groups could be using the same malware, which highlights the need to dig deep and find similarities in attack patterns rather than relying on malware-based analysis.\n“DarkGate has been around for a long time and is being used by many groups for different purposes, not just this group or cluster in Vietnam,” Stephen Robinson, Senior Threat Intelligence Analyst at WithSecure™, explains.\nOrganizations must remain vigilant and employ stringent cybersecurity mechanisms to prevent DarkGate and other malware threats. It is essential to ensure up-to-date antivirus solutions, educate employees on cybersecurity best practices, use strong passwords backed by MFA (multi-factor authentication), and monitor network activity for suspicious behavior.\nNew Malware “BunnyLoader 3.0” Steals Credentials and Crypto\nIn the scenario where cybersecurity threats are peeking, staying one step ahead of malicious actors is crucial to protecting your online business and identity. Recently, Palo Alto’s Unit 42 released a report shedding light on a dangerous new malware called BunnyLoader, and its latest version, BunnyLoader 3.0. Here’s what you need to know:\nBunnyLoader is not your average malware. It’s a sophisticated tool developed by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information, credentials, and even cryptocurrency from unsuspecting victims. What’s more, it’s constantly evolving, making it a challenging threat for the cybersecurity community.\nSince its discovery in September 2023 on Breach Forums, BunnyLoader has undergone multiple updates and enhancements, each aimed at outsmarting security measures and staying under the radar of cybersecurity researchers. From bug fixes to advanced keylogging capabilities, the creators of BunnyLoader are constantly tweaking their creation to maximize its effectiveness.\nOn February 11, 2024, the threat actors behind BunnyLoader unveiled their latest version, BunnyLoader 3.0, boasting a 90% improvement in performance. This new iteration comes with a reduced payload size and enhanced keylogging capabilities, making it even more dangerous than before.\nUnit 42’s technical write-up provides a glimpse into the inner workings of BunnyLoader, revealing the tactics and techniques used by its creators to evade detection. From changing file names to mimicking legitimate applications, BunnyLoader employs various strategies to stay hidden from cybersecurity experts.\nWith the threat of BunnyLoader looming large, it’s more important than ever to stay vigilant and take proactive measures to protect yourself and your online assets. By staying informed about the latest cyber threats and implementing robust security measures, you can minimize the risk of falling victim to malicious actors.\nNew Windows Infostealer ‘ExelaStealer’ Being Sold on Dark Web\nFortiGuard Labs has discovered a new infostealer in the cybercrime landscape called ExelaStealer mostly targeting Windows devices.\nThe infostealer is written in Python but uses resources in many different languages when required.\nThe malware deployment entails a decoy PDF file and executing obfuscated Python code.\nIt can steal sensitive user data, including session data and cookies, credit card details, passwords, and keystrokes. \nIt can collect extensive system data, including WLAN profiles and firewall status.\nExelaStealer is available in open-source and paid versions on the Dark web. The paid version comes with additional customization features.\nExelaStealer uses code obfuscation techniques to block analysis and reverse engineering efforts.\nWe have seen many infostealing malware emerging in cyberspace including Raccoon, RedLine, Vidar, and the relatively new entrant ThirdEye. However, the buzz in the cybersecurity world is that the yet-unknown ExelaStealer is far more dangerous than these.\nThe cybersecurity researchers at FortiGuard Labs discovered ExelaStealer in August 2023 and provided a detailed account of ExelaStealer’s workings in its new blog post. Per its research, the infostealer is offered as open-source and paid versions on the dark web, with the paid one featuring extended capabilities. \nThe malware is written in Python but often uses other language resources such as JavaScript. Windows-based systems are its key targets, whereas the malware looks for sensitive data such as passwords, session data, cookies, keystrokes, and credit card details.\nBoth versions of ExelaStealer are advertised on Dark Web forums with all the ads posted by a single contact using the handle “quicaxd.” For the paid version, the pricing structure varies. A monthly subscription is offered at $20, a three-month subscription is $45, and a lifetime subscription is $120. \nIt is worth noting that, according to FortiGuard Lab’s report, an active Telegram channel is used for facilitating purchases and getting access to the GitHub repository for the open-source version.\nGiven the infostealer’s open-source feature, it is possible for anyone with basic programming skills to create their own binaries using its source code. At the moment, ExelaStealer’s packaging and configuration are such that they can only affect Windows systems. \nAs per Fortiguard Labs, the binaries they analyzed have been released as part of a specific campaign, and the involvement of a decoy document further supports this assumption.\nResearchers couldn’t identify the initial attack vector, but they suspect it could be achieved through malware deployment, watering holes, or phishing attacks. The binary is the attack’s first stage, which spawns an executable (sirket-ruhsat-pdf.exe) and launches a PDF viewer to display a decoy document titled ‘BNG 824 ruhsat.pdf’ to the user. Sirket-ruhsat-pdf.exe and BNG 824 ruhsat.pdf are planted into the C: drive’s root directory in which the former is a PyInstaller-generated file while the latter is a decoy file.\nRegarding the attack stages, FortiGuard Labs researchers noted that the malware’s core functionality is embedded in a file titled Exela.py. The build process starts with a batch file that invokes Python and the ‘build.py’ file. The builder then uses a file titled ‘obf.py’ to hide the infostealer’s code and evade detection, reverse engineering, and analysis efforts. \nExcept for the library components, the obfuscated code is consolidated into a file titled ‘Obfuscated.py’ which is then deployed. The malware then starts gathering data along with executing a base64-encoded PowerShell command. The information is sent to the attacker’s Telegram channel, where the files are packaged into a ZIP archive and sent to a Discord webhook.\nTo protect yourself from ExelaStealer, users need to be on the lookout for watering holes and phishing attacks.  A watering hole attack is a type of cyberattack in which the attacker identifies and compromises a website that is frequented by a particular group of individuals or organizations. \nThe goal of this attack is to infect the visitors’ computers with malware or exploit vulnerabilities in their systems. The term “watering hole” is derived from the concept of predators waiting near watering holes in the wild to ambush their prey when they come to drink.\nTo protect against watering hole attacks, individuals and organizations should regularly update their software, use strong security measures, and be cautious when visiting websites, especially those that might be of interest to potential attackers. Additionally, security solutions that can detect and block malicious activity are essential for identifying and mitigating such attacks.\nQubitstrike Malware Hits Jupyter Notebooks for Cryptojacking and Cloud Data\nCryptojackers are targeting Jupyter Notebooks to deploy Qubitstrike malware, reports Cado Security.\nExposed Jupyter Notebooks are exploited in this campaign, mainly those deployed in cloud environments.\nThe objective is to steal cloud service providers’ credentials and access cloud services.\nQubitstrike is an evolving malware campaign looking for vulnerabilities in Jupyter Notebooks configurations and supporting SSH propagation.\nAttacks can install additional malware, steal sensitive data, and interrupt research activities.\nJupyter Notebooks are widely used tools by data scientists and researchers. According to new research from Cado Security Labs, threat actors are targeting vulnerable Jupyter Notebooks configurations to obtain unauthorized access to target systems and deploy Qubitstrike malware. \nThe primary objective of this campaign is to steal cloud services provider (CSP) credentials and install cryptominers. This indicates threat actors are trying to disrupt scientific research. Cado researchers noted that attackers use stolen CSP credentials to expand their scope of exploitation.\nIt is a multi-stage attack in which malware developers infiltrate the targeted system by sending phishing emails to unsuspecting users or using social engineering tactics. After successful infiltration, the malware establishes a connection with a remote C2 server to control the compromised system remotely. Once this is done, the attackers exploit the notebooks’ ability to execute arbitrary code for executing a malicious mi.sh shell script, disguised as a legitimate data analysis tool. \nThis script retrieves\/executes an XMRig miner and ensures it is executed every time the system is rebooted. It also terminates any existing mining operations in the system, adds the adversary’s SSH key to the system to create a persistent backdoor, and installs a rootkit to hide malicious processes.\nNow, attackers can perform a wide range of nefarious activities, including installing additional malware\/backdoors on the system, stealing intellectual property or sensitive data such as cloud service provider credentials, and interrupting\/sabotaging research. Attackers can deliver the shell script to related hosts through SSH as well. The data is exfiltrated via Telegram Bot API.  \nQubitstrike campaign payloads are hosted on the Git hosting platform’s alternative service, codeberg.org, and Discord is used for command and control communications. Cado Security researchers claim that this is the first time they discovered this platform being used in an active malware campaign.                                            \nIt’s possible that Codeberg’s up-and-coming status makes it attractive as a hosting service for malware developers,” Cado Security’s report read.\nQubitstrike malware’s advanced C2 infrastructure using Discord’s bot functionality for issuing commands on compromised nodes or tracking the campaign’s progress highlights the need to focus on this emerging threat targeting scientific computing environments and employ robust cybersecurity measures in these domains.\nFor your information, Jupyter Notebooks are web-based interactive computing platforms designed for remote or on-premise servers but generally, these are used in cloud environments. It hosts individual code snippets and lets users execute the code in an isolated environment. Google and Amazon Web Services (AWS) offer Jupyter Notebooks as managed services.\nROMCOMLITE: Stealthier Version of ROMCOM Backdoor Targets Female Politicians\nA notorious cyberespionage group Void Rabisu, aka Storm-0978, Tropical Scorpius, and UNC2596, has launched a brand-new campaign targeting female political leaders and government officials using a revamped version of a previously detected ROMCOM backdoor.\nHackread.com had reported in July 2023 that Void Rabisu is intensifying its efforts to target politicians, citing a report from the BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team about discovering a campaign where the group targeted Ukraine and NATO supporters with the ROMCOM backdoor RAT delivered via malicious documents.\nThe ROMCOMLITE campaign was discovered by Japanese cybersecurity firm Trend Micro. This new variant, dubbed ROMCOM 4.0 by Trend Micro and Peapod by Microsoft, allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the target’s computers and steal sensitive data. \nThe backdoor was detected in early August, and the malware analysis was published on 31 October. In the report, Feike Hacquebord and Fernando Merces explained that Void Rabisu’s targets were attendees of the Women Political Leaders (WPL) Summit held in Brussels in June 2023.\nFor your information, Void Rabisu is a sophisticated, hybrid group that conducts espionage and financially motivated attacks and prefers using the Cuba ransomware. It also serves as an APT actor targeting government and military entities\/officials. \nThe gang was discovered first in 2022, but researchers agree that it has been active for a long time. They also suspect this group harbours a geopolitical agenda, as most of its previous campaigns targeted the Ukrainian government\/military and EU political\/government governments.\nIn the recent campaign, Trend Micro noted that the backdoor payload was embedded in a malicious copy of the WPL Summit’s official website to improve gender equality in politics. The malicious new backdoor ROMCOM 4.0 is designed to evade detection and remain hidden on the infected system to avoid raising suspicion.\nAs per the report, the Videos &photos link of the original domain redirects the visitor to a Google Drive folder containing the event’s photographs. Then the fake website (wplsummitcom) directs the visitor to a OneDrive folder containing two compressed files and an executable file (titled: Unpublished Pictures 1-20230802T122531-002-sfx.exe), which is malware. \nThe gang created this fake website on 8 August, primarily to attract visitors from the original WPL summit domain. The executable file is signed with a valid certificate by a firm called Elbor LLC and extracts 56 photos from its resource section after the user clicks on Extract.\nAttackers use spear-phishing tactics to lure their targets. They send fake meeting invitations and other lures so that the targets open malicious attachments or click on links containing the malware. \nThis is a similar tactic Void Rabisu has used in its campaign discovered in June 2023, where the gang used lures related to the Ukrainian World Congress and the July NATO summit to deliver a zero-day exploit based on an RCE vulnerability in MS Office and Windows HTML, tracked as CVE-2023-36884. Microsoft disclosed this campaign in July.\nHowever, Trend Micro report reveals that the group has used a new tactic in this campaign involving TLS-enforcing by the RomCom C2 servers to make discovering ROMCOM’s infrastructure hard to detect.\n“We observed Void Rabisu using this technique in a May 2023 RomCom campaign that spread a malicious copy of the legitimate PaperCut software, in which the C2 server ignored requests that were not conformant,” the report read.\nTrend Micro claims there’s no evidence to believe Void Rabisu is a state-sponsored actor. Still, it is clear that the group is trying to benefit from the “extraordinary geopolitical circumstances caused by the war in Ukraine.”\nNew Vcurms Malware Targets Popular Browsers for Data Theft\nFortinet’s FortiGuard Labs recently uncovered a new cybersecurity threat: a malware known dubbed “Vcurms.” The attackers behind Vcurms malware have employed sophisticated tactics, using email as their command and control center and leveraging public services such as AWS and GitHub to store the malicious software. Additionally, they have employed a commercial protector to evade detection, indicating a concerted effort to maximize the malware’s impact.\nThis campaign primarily targets platforms with Java installed, posing a risk to any organization utilizing such systems. The severity of the threat cannot be understated, as successful infiltration grants attackers full control over compromised systems.\nThe modus operandi of the attackers involves luring users to download a malicious Java downloader, which serves as a vector for spreading Vcurms and STRRAT, a trojan previously found to be posing as fake ransomware infection to steal data. These malicious emails typically masquerade as legitimate requests, urging recipients to verify payment information and download harmful files hosted on AWS.\nOnce downloaded, the malware exhibits classic phishing traits, employing spoofed names and obfuscated strings to disguise its nefarious nature. Notably, it utilizes a class named “DownloadAndExecuteJarFiles.class” to facilitate the downloading and execution of additional JAR files, further expanding the attacker’s foothold.\nThe Remote Access Trojan (RAT) component of Vcurms communicates with its command and control center via email, demonstrating a concerning level of sophistication. It establishes persistence by replicating itself into the Startup folder and employs various techniques to identify and monitor victims, including keylogging and password recovery functionalities.\nFurthermore, the malware employs advanced obfuscation techniques, such as the Branchlock obfuscator, to evade detection and analysis. Despite these challenges, cybersecurity researchers continue to develop methods for deobfuscating and understanding the inner workings of Vcurms.\nVcurms also exhibits notable similarities with the Rude Stealer malware but distinguishes itself through its unique transmission methods and targeted data acquisition. It prioritizes stealing sensitive information from popular browsers like Chrome, Brave, Edge, Vialdi, Opera, OperaGX, Firefox, etc. and applications, including Discord and Steam.\nIn response to this threat, FortiGuard Labs in their blog post, recommend proactive measures, including the deployment of updated security solutions and network segmentation. Additionally, maintaining vital password practices and exercising caution when handling email attachments are crucial steps in mitigating the risk of Vcurms infection.\nCommenting on this, Jason Soroko, Senior Vice President of Product at Sectigo, emphasizes the importance of authentication methods in combating malware attacks. \n“Malware writers are benefiting from the cloud and that shouldn’t surprise anyone. RAT malware typically harvests whatever it can, and the new VCURMS and STRRAT remote access trojans seem to have one or more keyloggers,“ Jason warned. “This technique has been around for quite some time and is yet another example of why stronger authentication methods than simply a username and password are necessary.“\nMagnet Goblin Hackers Using Ivanti Flaws to Deploy Linux Malware\nCybersecurity researchers at Check Point are warning of a malicious campaign targeting one-day vulnerabilities in Ivanti and other security software products, potentially impacting a wide range of organizations. \nThe culprit behind this campaign is a financially motivated hacker group known as Magnet Goblin. This group has been active since January 2022 and specializes in leveraging newly disclosed vulnerabilities, targeting public-facing servers and edge devices.\nAccording to Check Point’s research, Magnet Goblin is using one-day security vulnerabilities to breach edge devices and public-facing services and deploy custom malware on Linux systems. For your information, after zero-day vulnerabilities are disclosed publicly and patches are released, they are referred to as one-day vulnerabilities.\nThe attackers exploit unpatched servers like Ivanti Connect Secure VPN, Magento, Qlik Sense, and possibly Apache ActiveMQ to deploy a cross-platform remote access trojan (RAT) called Nerbian RAT, first documented by Proofpoint in 2022. It also utilized Nerbian RAT’s simplified variant, MiniNerbian, which allows arbitrary command execution from a C2 server. \n“NerbianRAT and MiniNerbian… these tools have operated under the radar as they mostly reside on edge devices. This is part of an ongoing trend for threat actors to target areas which until now have been left unprotected,” researchers noted.\nNerbianRAT is downloaded from compromised systems with critical Ivanti Connect Secure flaws. While researching, CheckPoint discovered a 1-day vulnerability infection that led to the download of the NerbianRAT Linux variant. \nThe variant was used to execute various malicious activities on compromised systems, including modifying connection intervals, work time settings, and updating configuration variables.\nMagnet Goblin leveraged CVE-2023-46805, CVE-2024-21887, CVE-2024-21888, and CVE-2024-21893 in Ivanti VPNs, CVE-2022-24086 in Magento, and CVE-2023-41265, CVE-2023-41266, and CVE-2023-48365 in Qlik Sense. \nThey used a JavaScript credential stealer called Warpwire and the open-source tunnelling tool Ligolo to exploit these vulnerabilities. Warpwire stealer is linked to mass Ivanti vulnerability exploitation and was used in a 2022 Magento server attack. In addition, they used remote monitoring tools ScreenConnect and AnyDesk, targeting Qlik Sense and Apache ActiveMQ.\nIt is worth noting that Ivanti issued a public advisory in January for CVE-2024-21887, a command injection vulnerability, urging users to patch their systems against wild exploitations. However, Check Point found that Magnet Goblin exploitations occurred within a day of patch issuance, targeting systems not yet patched with available fixed updates.\nJohn Gallagher, Vice President of Viakoo Labs at Viakoo commented on the findings stating, “It’s clear that Magnet Goblin is taking the easy route; using recently disclosed vulnerabilities to exploit poorly defended systems. With many edge and IoT devices and applications there is a lag time between when a vulnerability is disclosed and when a patch is available…and then another lag time between when the patch is released and when it is implemented.”\n“Often the teams managing edge and IoT systems are outside of IT and may have different priorities or sense of urgency when it comes to patching. One can expect that one-day threats will be a major security issue, as the speed of AI can accelerate these specific types of threats. Until the speed of delivery by threat actors is matched by the speed of response by defenders this will be an ongoing security risk.”\nOrganisations of all sizes relying on Ivanti software for endpoint management and security are at potential risk. This includes companies in various sectors that utilize Ivanti to safeguard their critical infrastructure. \nTherefore, patching Ivanti software is necessary to prevent exploitation along with increased monitoring, and adopting a layered security approach, including implementing Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions to strengthen the overall security of the network and devices.\nNew Linux Malware Alert: ‘Spinning YARN’ Hits Docker, Other Key Apps\nCado Security Labs has discovered an emerging Linux malware campaign dubbed Spinning Yarn targeting misconfigured servers running Apache Hadoop YARN, Docker, Confluence, and Redis web-facing services. \nThe emergence of the new Linux malware shouldn’t come as a surprise, given the recent surge in threats targeting Linux devices and servers. Just a couple of days ago, an old Linux malware known as Bifrost RAT resurfaced with a new variant that mimics VMware domains.\nAccording to Cado Security’s research research shared with Hackread.com ahead of publication on Wednesday, Spinning Yarn is a malicious campaign that exploits weaknesses in popular Linux software used by businesses across various sectors. \nThese services are crucial components in organizations’ IT infrastructure. Docker is critical for developing, deploying, and managing containerized applications. Apache Hadoop allows distributed processing of large datasets. Redis, a widely used in-memory data store, helps in caching real-time applications, and Confluence allows collaboration and knowledge management.\nBy compromising these applications, attackers can gain unauthorized access to systems, steal sensitive data, disrupt operations, or deploy ransomware, posing a significant threat to servers and critical infrastructure.\nIn Spinning Yarn, threat actors have used several unique payloads, including four Golang binaries that automate the discovery and infection of hosts and let them exploit code. They use Confluence to exploit common misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, launching Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks and infecting new hosts. \nThe attackers exploit CVE-2022-26134, an n-day vulnerability in Confluence, and deploy a container for the Docker compromise. The vulnerability has been exploited since 2022, including by Mirai malware variant V3G4 against IoT devices for DDoS attacks\nFurther probing revealed a series of shell scripts and standard Linux attack techniques used to deliver a cryptocurrency miner, spawn a reverse shell, and enable persistent access to compromised hosts. They also deploy an instance of the Platypus open-source reverse shell utility to maintain access. \nIn an attempt to evade detection, multiple user-mode rootkits are deployed. Researchers observed that the shell script payloads employed in this campaign share similarities with those used in previous cloud attacks.\nIn their blog post, Cado Security Labs detailed initial access activity on a docker Engine API honeypot on this IP address: 47966971. The attacker spawned a new container using Alpine Linux and created a bind mount for the underlying server’s root directory. This technique is common in Docker attacks, allowing attackers to write files to the host and execute a job for the Cron scheduler eventually achieving RCE. \nIn this campaign, the attacker wrote an executable and registered a Cron job to execute base64-encoded shell commands. Such extensive attack on Linux applications demonstrates attackers’ growing sophistication in targeting web-facing services in cloud environments, keeping abreast of vulnerabilities. \nTo mitigate the risks from campaigns like Spinning Yarn, regularly update software, enable strong passwords, educate employees on cybersecurity best practices, segment your network to limit potential damage, and deploy security solutions like endpoint security solutions and firewalls to detect and prevent malware infections. This will help protect against known vulnerabilities and ensure a secure
